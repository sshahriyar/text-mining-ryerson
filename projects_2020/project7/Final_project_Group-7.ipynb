    "# Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "To cope with the ever-emerging information overload, digital libraries employ literature recommender systems. These\n",
    "systems recommend related documents with the help of similarity measures, which often only distinguish between similar and dissimilar documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to design the model for finding the relationship between two documents as a pairwise document classification task. To find the semantic relation between documents, a series of techniques, such as GloVe, Paragraph-Vectors, BERT, and XLNet under different configurations (e.g., sequence length, vector concatenation scheme), including a Siamese architecture for the Transformer-based systems. The experiments performed on a newly proposed dataset of 32,168 Wikipedia article pairs and Wikidata properties that define the semantic document relations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Context of the Problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "Many digital libraries recommend literature to their users considering the similarity between a query document and their repository. However, they often fail to distinguish what is the relationship that makes two documents alike. It remains unclear to which of the many facets the similarity relates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the the findings we can deduce that classifying semantic relations between documents is a solvable task and motivates the development of recommender systems based on the evaluated techniques. The discussions in the paper serves as first steps in the exploration of documents through SPARQL-like queries such that one could find documents that are similar in one aspect but dissimilar in another.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitation About other Approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "While other NLP tasks, like relation extraction, deal with relations, they are not concerned with semantic relations between documents.The choice of similarity measures is widely used and works well on a wide range of documents, but has no theoretical basis. A similarity measure is a function which computes the degree of similarity between a pair of vectors or documents. Since queries and documents are both vectors, a similarity measure can represent the similarity between two documents, two queries, or one document and one query. There are a large number of similarity measures proposed in the past, because the best similarity measure doesn't exist yet. \n",
    "\n",
    "The other limitations that exists at present are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Synonyms: separate words that have the same meaning. (E.g. ‘car’ & ‘automobile’). They tend to reduce recall.\n",
    "Polysems: words with multiple meanings (E.g. ‘Java’). They tend to reduce precision. The problem is more general: there is a disconnect between topicsand words\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF is based on the bag-of-words (BoW) model, therefore it does not capture position in text, semantics, co-occurrences in different documents, etc. It cannont capture semantics (e.g. as compared to topic models, word embeddings).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "The task of finding semantic document relations is implemented as a multi-class classification of document pairs. The paper demonstrated the viability of this approach with a new proposed dataset of 32,168 Wikipedia article pairs and Wikidata properties that define semantic relations among these articles. In an empirical study, implemented six different models AvgGloVe, Doc2vec, Siamese BERT, Siamese XLNet, vanilla BERT and vanilla XLNet, and evaluate them under\n",
    "different settings regarding the concatenation method and sequence length. The evaluation indicates a sequence length of\n",
    "512 tokens as the best performing sequence limit for the Siamese and vanilla Transformer models. "

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we tried to mimic the implementation based on the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.09881\n",
    "\n",
    "Bär et al. [7] discuss the notion of similarity between texts in the context of NLP. They express that while text similarity is present in many NLP tasks, the similarity is often ill-defined and used as an “umbrella term covering quite different phenomena”. Bär et al. [7] formalize text similarity and suggest content, structure, and style as the major dimensions inherent to texts. Structure and style are not actively being accounted for. Therefore, we focused only on the content. With the classification of semantic document relations, we intend to tailor recommendations depending on specific information needs. For example, we could provide either recommendations focusing on a particular relation class or diverse recommendations from multiple relation classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Transformer architecture allowed the efficient unsupervised pretraining of language models and led to significant improvements in many NLP benchmarks. Akkalyoncu Yilmaz et al. [3] applied BERT to an information retrieval system for\n",
    "an end-to-end search over large document collections. Despite their success in NLP, Transformers have gained little attention in the recommender system community so far.  In our experiments, we utilize the article text and learn the document relation using a multilayer perceptron (MLP).\n",

    "# Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we combine the ideas of relation extraction, document classification, and document similarity to classify the semantic\n",

    "\n",
    "To evaluate the presented techniques, we build a dataset using Wikipedia and Wikidata repositories to illustrate our problem. Wikipedia articles are the seed and target documents, while Wikidata properties provide the semantic relations between a document pair. The following figure shows one example from the dataset:\n",

This study further suggests that a system can be built that enables users to explore scientific literature in an analogical manner.

As this process requires very rigorously cleaned dataset with defined relationship between the target documents, it will be worth studying the possible workarounds."
