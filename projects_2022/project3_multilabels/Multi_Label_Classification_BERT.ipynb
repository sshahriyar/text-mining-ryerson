        "# **Introduction**\n",
        " \n",
        "#### Problem Description:\n",
        " \n",
        "This paper aims to explore the impact of pre-trained word embeddings and language models on multi-label text classification. In this specific task, by classifying jobs into  categories based on their descriptions, Tran et al.[1] seek to improve the ability of both recruiters and job seekers to find relevant candidates for their open positions, and jobs that fit their experiences, respectively. This task can also be perceived as assigning keywords to jobs. Before moving forward, it must also be noted that, in this paper, these job categories/keywords are referred to as \"job titles\" but for clarity we will use the terms \"categories\" or \"keywords\" instead since the labels are more general than typical job titles.\n",
        "#### Context of the Problem:\n",
        " \n",
        "In several NLP tasks, pre-trained word embeddings (fastText, ELMO) and language models (XLM-R, BERT and its variations)  have proven to be integral to the success of a classifier. However, the main question Tran et al. focus on in this study is: How effective are they when there are over 60 non-exclusive classes to pick from?\n",
        " \n",
        "Looking through the lense of this particular problem setting, with the development of online job searching and recruitment, the ability for recruiters to find relevant candidates, and job seekers to find the jobs they're looking for has never been easier. However, one of the main ways in which jobs are found is through searching keywords associated with the general industry of interest such as 'Marketing' or 'Real Estate'. Therefore, it is important for recruiters to be aware of what potential categories their job description may fall under or be assoicated to so that they can make sure the appropriate candidates are able to find the posting. Furthermore, being able to classify  and extract potential labels from descriptions could also help recommend potential job types for candidates based on the requirements they are looking to fill.\n",
        " \n",
        " \n",
        "#### Limitation About other Approaches:\n",
        " \n",
        "The main difference between this research and its predecessors is that the previous papers focused only on multi class classification where they were trying to predict a single job title/label, whereas this studies multi-label classification where a job description can have more than one relevant option.\n",
        " \n",
        "#### Solution:\n",
        " \n",
        "Our proposed method involves the use of a BERT model to solve this multi-label prediction task. As seen in previous papers and in Tran et al., deep learning NLP models, especially BERT, are able to detect complex relationships within text data and have proven results in multi-label classification tasks[1][4].\n",

        " \n",
        "To ensure consistency and standardization across all job labels, we mapped similar labels to their standardized versions. For example, [\" \\'advice\\', \\'customer service\\', \\'sales / business\\'\"] will be mapped to ['Advise', 'Customer service', 'Sales / Business']. Levenshtein distance was used as our similarity measure. Additionally, to deal with class imbalances, any label with fewer than 150 training instances was dropped.\n",
        " \n",
        "##BERT Model\n",
        "The training set in a multi-label classification issue is made up of examples each of which can be allocated to many categories represented by a set of target labels, and the aim is to predict the label set of test data, for example.\n",
        "- eg. Job description text might be from any category i.e IT and Software, Architect so for each X we can have output label Y as\n",
        "[1, 0, 0, 1, 1].\n",
        " \n",
        "To solve this problem BERT was implemented. BERT is superior to other bidirectional models because it uses a bidirectional self-attention mechanism that carries out bidirectional conditioning allowing each word to indirectly \"see itself\" in a multi-layered context. Other than that, BERT also uses attention masks which pays attention to the part of the sentence which is critical to the classification label. More specifically, for this task bert-base-uncased is used which has a 12-encoder stack all of which are transformer blocks.\n",
