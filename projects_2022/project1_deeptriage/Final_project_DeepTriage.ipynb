    "# Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "Software engineering teams for large software applications receive a plethora of bug reports outlining issues with various aspects of their applications. With the increasing complexity of software, bug reports come in larger numbers and in greater variety, presenting a problem for both developers solving bugs and the processes/members responsible for assigning bugs to appropriate developers for effective resolution (the bug triaging problem). \n",
    "\n",
    "Bug triaging presents a challenging NLP classification task given the nature of bug reports. Bug reports are generated by end users and are typically a combination of formal language/sentences as well as code stacks (e.g., java/python functions, other code, bug traces). This generates noise in the data which makes it difficult for models to separate classes in classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "The paper \"DeepTriage: Exploring the Effectiveness of Deep Learning for Bug Triaging\" explores a deep neural network to capture syntactical and sequential word information present in bug reports. More specifically, they present a deep bi-directional recurrent neural network with Word2Vec embeddings and a soft attention mechanism (DBRNN-A). After processing bug report data for several different software data sources, they compare rank-10 classification performance between their DBRNN-A and standard bag-of-word (BOW) models found in related literature. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Context of the Problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the domain of software engineering, the bug triaging classification problem is relevant because of the growing complexity of softwares, teams, and the processes underpinning their effective operations. Bottlenecks in effective bug triaging processes can strain developer resources and time which already face severe constraints, particularly in technology companies where there are many ongoing projects and little time to waste on menial tasks. Automated bug triaging can help tremendously in operational efficiency, thus, trickling its benefits to the team's general operations through time savings. In addition, an automated bug triaging solution that is capable of finding the right developer for a particular problem should, theoretically, reduce total time to resolution for bugs by assigning developers based on past experience on certain types of bugs because developers with repeated experience in special areas of troubleshooting benefit from higher transfer learning with their past experience.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Outside of the software engineering domain, the bug triaging problem can be viewed as an important area for understanding noisy textual data in general, as well as the types of processing and modeling methods that are effective in extracting the relevant contextual/semantic information for related problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitation About other Approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior approaches to bug triaging have limitations in their ability to capture semantic information from the text descriptions of bugs. More specifically, BOW models treat text as an unordered collection of words, eliminating the hidden meaning behind their sequences. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep RNNs (as used in the DeepTriage paper) can extract such sequential information to improve classification performance. It does this through long short-term memory (LSTM) layers, treating each bug report description as a sequence and learning from word to word in order to capture additional information from the text. The authors also employ a soft attention mechanism which further allows the model to distinguish which parts of the bug description are most important for the task at hand which, theoretically, reduces noise in the data.

    "# Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "The model proposed by Mani et al. [1] is a bi-directional LSTM with a soft attention layer (termed as 'DBRNN-A'). The figures below are directly from the DeepTriage paper. \n",
    "To implement the DBRNN-A, the approach is shown below where all bug reports in the dataset are first cleaned (stripped of URLs, stack traces, tokenized, and case folded) (steps 1-3). Afterwards, all bugs (untriaged and triaged) are used for training a Deep learning-based bug feature representation via Word2Vec (step 5). Using these Word2Vec embeddings, the DBRNN-A model is trained only on the triaged bugs (since these are the instances with actual labels) (steps 6-10). \n",
    "\n",
    "This project will implement this DBRNN-A model, along with the BOW models (MNB and Logistic Regression/Softmax). The model runs are repeated for 10-fold validation on the dataset, and re-run for varying training thresholds per label. Training thresholds are defined as the minimum number of training instances per unique label in the dataset, and the parameters run are 0, 5, 10, and 20 threshold instances. This training threshold filtration is performed as there are many developers with very few bug report instances, generating noise and imbalance in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "![DT_approach](figures/DT_approach.png \"DeepTriage Approach\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The DBRNN-A model architecture is shown below: \n",
    "\n",
    "![DT_model](plots/model_plots/dbrnna_model_plot.png \"DeepTriage Model\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on their implementation, below shows the results of the DBRNN-A model that we'll use to compare against the performance obtained in this replication project. Most notably, a subset of the Chromium bug report dataset will be used for this project, and results will be compared against the highest performing model (with minimum training threshold of 20 instances per label).\n",
    "\n",
    "![DT_results](figures/DT_results.png \"DeepTriage Results\")\n",
    "\n",
    "In extension of the paper, I also explore tuning of the size of the units for LSTM and Dense layers in the DBRNN-A model to assess whether the proposed architecture by Mani et al. [1] is optimal, or might have room for exploration in hyperparameter tuning. \n"

    "# Conclusion and Future Direction\n",
    "### Results\n",
    "Given the data used in this project is different than the dataset used by Mani et al. [1], I anticipated different performance results, even when running identical models. However, a key limitation exists where Mani et al. implemented chronological time cross-validation (using a sliding window for training and testing sets) whereas this implementation implements a standard cross-validation procedure given the absence of a date/time feature in the available dataset. In addition, the DBRNN-A model proposed does appear to be heavily overfitting, possibly due to the size of the layers used and the general complexity of the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The comparison analysis performed using different sizes of LSTM and Dense layer units revealed that performance of the proposed DBRNN-A was improved with a smaller, less complex model compared to the architecture size proposed by Mani et al. [1]. Therefore, there is additional work that can be done to explore hyper-parameter tuning to improve model performance since the smaller models shown here are more favorable due to their decreased complexity, faster training time, and increased resistance to overfitting. In addition, pretrained models like BERT (or other variants) can be employed in future work to attempt to capture more semantic information from bug reports to better enable developer assignment.   \n",
    "\n",
    "### Learnings\n",
    "In general, it was found that the text classification task becomes much more difficult when text input is extremely noisy and variable. Compared to other multi-class NLP tasks, bug triaging is particularly difficult because of the combination of both natural language as well as code traces and non-english word in the input data (bug reports) (compared to simpler classification tasks with english-only words like sentiment analysis for movies or news article classification). As a result, the processing steps and modeling become increasingly important due to this noise in order to achieve reasonable model accuracy.\n",
    "In addition, it's been shown the importance of exploring less complex architectures as they may be helpful in improving overall model performance in noisy input environments. "
