========================================
problem: There is a polygon with coordinates [(-3.0, 1.4), (-5.3, -2.8), (-0.9, -5.7), (3.6, -3.3), (2.0, 1.2)]. There is a polygon with coordinates [(4.3, 2.5), (-1.8, 1.2), (-1.4, -3.5), (5.1, -3.6)]. How many intersection points are there?
result: To determine the number of intersection points between the two polygons provided, we need to analyze the segments of both polygons. 

Here are the coordinates of the two polygons:

First Polygon (P1):
1. A(-3.0, 1.4)
2. B(-5.3, -2.8)
3. C(-0.9, -5.7)
4. D(3.6, -3.3)
5. E(2.0, 1.2)

Second Polygon (P2):
1. F(4.3, 2.5)
2. G(-1.8, 1.2)
3. H(-1.4, -3.5)
