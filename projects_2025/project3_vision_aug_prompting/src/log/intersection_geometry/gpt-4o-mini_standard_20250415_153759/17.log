========================================
problem: There is a polygon with coordinates [(-1.7, -2.2), (3.4, -0.4), (-1.6, 2.9)]. There is a polygon with coordinates [(-3.0, 1.1), (-3.7, -3.8), (1.3, -5.5), (4.2, -1.4), (1.1, 2.0)]. How many intersection points are there?
result: To determine the number of intersection points between the two polygons defined by their coordinates, we will need to analyze each polygon's edges to see if they intersect with each other.

**Polygon 1 vertices:**
1. A = (-1.7, -2.2)
2. B = (3.4, -0.4)
3. C = (-1.6, 2.9)

**Polygon 2 vertices:**
1. D = (-3.0, 1.1)
2. E = (-3.7, -3.8)
3. F = (1.3, -5.5)
4. G = (4.2, -1.4)
5. H =
