========================================
problem: There is a line segment from (2.7, -4.0) to (-2.4, 0.4). There is a polygon with coordinates [(-5.0, 2.8), (-3.6, -1.5), (2.6, -2.3), (0.4, 4.3)]. How many intersection points are there?
result: To determine the number of intersection points between the given line segment and the polygon, we will follow these steps:

1. **Define the Line Segment:**
   The line segment is defined by the endpoints \( A(2.7, -4.0) \) and \( B(-2.4, 0.4) \).

2. **Define the Polygon:**
   The polygon is defined by the vertices given in the coordinates:
   - \( P_1(-5.0, 2.8) \)
   - \( P_2(-3.6, -1.5) \)
   - \( P_3(2.6, -2.3) \)
   - \( P_4
