========================================
problem: There is a polygon with coordinates [(2.2, -1.0), (-0.8, 3.3), (-5.0, 0.9), (-1.6, -4.0)]. There is a polygon with coordinates [(-2.7, -0.8), (1.2, -4.4), (5.0, 1.1), (-0.8, 4.3)]. How many intersection points are there?
result: To determine the number of intersection points between the two polygons given by their coordinates, we need to analyze the vertices and edges of each polygon and check for possible intersections.

**Step 1: Identify the polygons**
- Polygon A has vertices: 
  - A1: (2.2, -1.0)
  - A2: (-0.8, 3.3)
  - A3: (-5.0, 0.9)
  - A4: (-1.6, -4.0)

- Polygon B has vertices:
  - B1: (-2.7, -0.8)
  - B2: (1.2, -4.4)
  - B3:
