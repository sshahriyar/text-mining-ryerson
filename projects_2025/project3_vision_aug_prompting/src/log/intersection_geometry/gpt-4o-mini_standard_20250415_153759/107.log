========================================
problem: There is a polygon with coordinates [(-2.2, -0.2), (5.7, -1.9), (2.2, 3.9)]. There is a line segment from (-1.7, -1.1) to (-2.5, -1.1). There is a circle centered at (0.5, -1.9) with radius 3.0. There is a line segment from (1.6, -0.4) to (-2.5, 1.2). How many intersection points are there?
result: To find the number of intersection points for the given shapes and lines, we need to analyze each one individually:

1. **Polygon**: The polygon has the following vertices:
   - A = (-2.2, -0.2)
   - B = (5.7, -1.9)
   - C = (2.2, 3.9)

   We will identify the segments forming the polygon:
   - Segment AB from A to B
   - Segment BC from B to C
   - Segment CA from C to A

2. **Line Segment (-1.7, -1.1) to (-2.5, -1.1)**: This is a horizontal line segment at y =
