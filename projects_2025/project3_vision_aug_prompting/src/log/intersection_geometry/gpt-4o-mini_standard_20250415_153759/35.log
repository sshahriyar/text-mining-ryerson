problem: There is a circle centered at (1.1, 1.3) with radius 1.0. There is a polygon with coordinates [(-7.2, 0.7), (0.4, -4.1), (0.6, 3.9)]. How many intersection points are there?
result: To find the number of intersection points between the given shapes (a circle and a polygon), we can follow a systematic approach:

1. **Circle**: The circle is centered at (1.1, 1.3) with a radius of 1.0. The equation of the circle is:
   \[
   (x - 1.1)^2 + (y - 1.3)^2 = 1^2
   \]

2. **Polygon**: The polygon is defined by the vertices \((-7.2, 0.7)\), \((0.4, -4.1)\), and \((0.6, 3.9)\). This forms a triangle with the
