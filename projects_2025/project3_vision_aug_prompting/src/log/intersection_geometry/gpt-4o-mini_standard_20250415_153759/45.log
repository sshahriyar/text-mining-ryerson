========================================
problem: There is a circle centered at (1.7, 0.8) with radius 1.0. There is a polygon with coordinates [(-2.6, -1.7), (5.0, -1.9), (2.0, 3.5)]. There is a circle centered at (1.9, -1.2) with radius 2.0. How many intersection points are there?
result: To find the number of intersection points between the shapes specified (a circle, a polygon, and another circle), we can analyze each pair:

1. **Circle and Polygon Intersection**:
   - Consider the geometry of the circle centered at (1.7, 0.8) with radius 1.0, and the polygon defined by the coordinates [(-2.6, -1.7), (5.0, -1.9), (2.0, 3.5)].
   - The circle will have a limited area where it can intersect the polygon. By calculating the distance from the center of the circle to the lines forming the polygon and checking if they fall within the radius, we can determine potential intersection points
