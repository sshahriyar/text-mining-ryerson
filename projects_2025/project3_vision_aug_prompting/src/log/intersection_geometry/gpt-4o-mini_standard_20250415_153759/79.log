========================================
problem: There is a line segment from (0.8, 0.3) to (-2.9, 0.2). There is a circle centered at (-1.0, -0.8) with radius 3.0. There is a circle centered at (-1.1, 1.7) with radius 3.0. How many intersection points are there?
result: To determine the number of intersection points in the second input scenario, we analyze the relationships between the given line segment and the two circles.

1. **Line Segment**: The line segment runs from (0.8, 0.3) to (-2.9, 0.2).

2. **Circle 1**: Centered at (-1.0, -0.8) with radius 3.0. The equation for this circle is:
   \[
   (x + 1.0)^2 + (y + 0.8)^2 = 3.0^2
   \]
   which simplifies to:
   \[
   (x + 1.0)^2 + (y
