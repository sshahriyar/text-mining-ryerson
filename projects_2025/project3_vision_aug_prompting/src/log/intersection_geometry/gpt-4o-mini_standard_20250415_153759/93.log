========================================
problem: There is a polygon with coordinates [(4.7, 1.8), (-3.8, 1.5), (0.3, -4.7)]. There is a circle centered at (1.6, -0.1) with radius 1.0. There is a circle centered at (-1.5, -1.8) with radius 4.0. There is a polygon with coordinates [(1.5, 6.0), (-3.3, 2.3), (0.2, -2.2), (4.3, 1.9)]. How many intersection points are there?
result: To find the number of intersection points between the given shapes and lines, we need to analyze the two polygons and the two circles and determine their interrelations.

1. **Polygon 1: [(4.7, 1.8), (-3.8, 1.5), (0.3, -4.7)]**
2. **Circle 1: Centered at (1.6, -0.1) with radius 1.0**
3. **Circle 2: Centered at (-1.5, -1.8) with radius 4.0**
4. **Polygon 2: [(1.5, 6.0), (-3.3, 2.3),
