========================================
problem: There is a polygon with coordinates [(3.3, 1.7), (-1.3, 2.2), (-4.3, -2.9), (0.7, -5.7), (5.3, -2.5)]. There is a polygon with coordinates [(-0.4, -5.3), (4.8, -2.3), (3.2, 2.7), (-0.4, 1.6), (-3.5, -0.5)]. How many intersection points are there?
result: To find the number of intersection points between the two polygons given by their vertices, we can proceed as follows:

1. **Define the polygons**: 
   - The first polygon has the vertices \( A_1 = (3.3, 1.7) \), \( A_2 = (-1.3, 2.2) \), \( A_3 = (-4.3, -2.9) \), \( A_4 = (0.7, -5.7) \), and \( A_5 = (5.3, -2.5) \).
   - The second polygon has the vertices \( B_1 = (-0.4, -5.3) \),
