========================================
problem: There is a circle centered at (0.4, -0.7) with radius 2.0. There is a line segment from (2.1, -0.2) to (1.9, -1.7). There is a circle centered at (1.2, -0.6) with radius 2.0. There is a circle centered at (-1.7, -0.2) with radius 2.0. How many intersection points are there?
result: To find the number of intersection points between the provided shapes (circles and line segments), I will analyze each of the objects involved. 

1. **Circle 1**: Center at (0.4, -0.7), radius = 2.0
    - The equation for this circle is: 
      \[
      (x - 0.4)^2 + (y + 0.7)^2 = 2^2
      \]

2. **Line Segment**: From (2.1, -0.2) to (1.9, -1.7)
    - To represent this line segment mathematically, we can calculate its equation in slope-intercept form or point-slope
