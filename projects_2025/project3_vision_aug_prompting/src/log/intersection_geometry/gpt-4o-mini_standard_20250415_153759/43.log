========================================
problem: There is a polygon with coordinates [(-0.5, 4.8), (-0.5, -0.7), (3.3, 1.2)]. There is a polygon with coordinates [(2.4, -0.7), (2.2, 3.9), (-2.0, 0.2)]. There is a polygon with coordinates [(3.5, -2.2), (1.4, 1.3), (-2.8, 1.7), (-2.4, -2.2), (-0.2, -6.1)]. How many intersection points are there?
result: To find the number of intersection points between the specified polygons, we will analyze how the vertices and edges of each polygon interact with one another.

1. **Polygon 1** with coordinates [(-0.5, 4.8), (-0.5, -0.7), (3.3, 1.2)] has the following vertices:
   - A(-0.5, 4.8)
   - B(-0.5, -0.7)
   - C(3.3, 1.2)
  
2. **Polygon 2** with coordinates [(2.4, -0.7), (2.2, 3.9), (-2.0, 0.
