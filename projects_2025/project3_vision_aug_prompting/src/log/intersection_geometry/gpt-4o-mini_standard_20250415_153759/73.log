========================================
problem: There is a circle centered at (-0.2, 1.1) with radius 1.0. There is a polygon with coordinates [(-0.9, -6.1), (2.9, -4.4), (3.5, -0.1), (-1.4, 2.9), (-3.2, -2.2)]. There is a circle centered at (1.2, -1.3) with radius 2.0. How many intersection points are there?
result: To determine the number of intersection points between the specified geometric shapes (a circle and a polygon, and another circle), we will analyze each element as follows:

### Step 1: Circle and Polygon
1. **Circle**: Centered at \((-0.2, 1.1)\) with a radius of \(1.0\).
   - The equation of the circle can be written as:
     \[
     (x + 0.2)^2 + (y - 1.1)^2 = 1
     \]

2. **Polygon**: Given by its vertices \[(-0.9, -6.1), (2.9, -4.4), (3.5,
