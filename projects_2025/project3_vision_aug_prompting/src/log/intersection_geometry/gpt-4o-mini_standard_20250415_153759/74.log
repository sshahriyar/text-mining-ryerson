========================================
problem: There is a circle centered at (-1.0, -2.0) with radius 3.0. There is a line segment from (1.7, 0.4) to (-3.3, 2.1). There is a line segment from (3.1, 2.4) to (3.4, 3.6). How many intersection points are there?
result: To determine the number of intersection points between the circle and the line segments, we can analyze each component step by step.

1. **Circle Details**: The circle is centered at (-1.0, -2.0) with a radius of 3.0. The equation of the circle is:

   \[
   (x + 1.0)^2 + (y + 2.0)^2 = 3.0^2
   \]
   or equivalently,
   \[
   (x + 1.0)^2 + (y + 2.0)^2 = 9
   \]

2. **First Line Segment**: The first line segment runs from (1.7,
