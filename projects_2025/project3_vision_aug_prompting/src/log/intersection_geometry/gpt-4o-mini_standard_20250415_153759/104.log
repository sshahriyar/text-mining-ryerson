========================================
problem: There is a polygon with coordinates [(2.8, -1.7), (1.8, 2.6), (-1.0, 5.6), (-4.1, 2.3), (-2.8, -2.2)]. There is a circle centered at (-1.1, -0.8) with radius 1.0. There is a line segment from (2.5, 3.2) to (-2.6, 0.5). There is a line segment from (-0.4, 1.8) to (-0.7, 1.7). How many intersection points are there?
result: To determine the number of intersection points between the given shapes (a polygon and a circle) and the line segments, we analyze the intersections systematically.

1. **Polygon and Circle**: 
   - The polygon with coordinates \[(2.8, -1.7), (1.8, 2.6), (-1.0, 5.6), (-4.1, 2.3), (-2.8, -2.2)\] has vertices that can be checked against the circle defined by the center at \((-1.1, -0.8)\) and radius \(1.0\).
   - We calculate whether each edge of the polygon intersects the circle. Each edge is defined by pairs
