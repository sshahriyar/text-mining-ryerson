========================================
problem: There is a line segment from (0.9, 1.3) to (0.6, 3.9). There is a circle centered at (1.1, -0.8) with radius 3.0. There is a circle centered at (1.1, 0.8) with radius 4.0. There is a line segment from (2.5, 2.1) to (-3.0, 1.3). How many intersection points are there?
result: To determine the number of intersection points between the specified shapes and lines, we will analyze each geometric figure and check for intersections.

1. **Line Segment from (0.9, 1.3) to (0.6, 3.9):**
   We will denote this line segment as Line A.

2. **Circle centered at (1.1, -0.8) with radius 3.0:**
   This is Circle B1, with the equation \((x - 1.1)^2 + (y + 0.8)^2 = 3^2\).

3. **Circle centered at (1.1, 0.8) with radius 4.0:**
