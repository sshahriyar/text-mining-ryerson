problem: There is a polygon with coordinates [(-3.8, -0.9), (2.6, -0.3), (-3.1, 5.3)]. There is a polygon with coordinates [(-1.3, 4.5), (-4.0, 1.6), (-3.0, -3.9), (2.7, -3.2), (1.8, 2.4)]. There is a circle centered at (1.7, -1.4) with radius 1.0. There is a circle centered at (-1.9, -0.9) with radius 2.0. How many intersection points are there?
result: To find the number of intersection points between the given polygons and circles, we need to analyze the shapes involved in the input.

1. **Intersections between polygons:**
   - We will need to check each edge of the first polygon against each edge of the second polygon for intersection points. This can be done using line segment intersection formulas.

2. **Intersections between polygons and circles:**
   - We need to check each edge of both polygons against each circle to find if they intersect. The intersection of a line segment and a circle can be computed using the parametric equation of the line and checking for real solutions.

3. **Intersections between circles:**
   - Finally, we need to consider whether the circles intersect each other. Two
