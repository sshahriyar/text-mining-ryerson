problem: There is a circle centered at (-1.7, 1.6) with radius 4.0. There is a line segment from (0.6, -0.6) to (-1.1, -1.4). There is a line segment from (0.9, 3.4) to (2.5, 1.2). How many intersection points are there?
result: To determine the number of intersection points between the specified shapes and lines, we will analyze each intersection step-by-step. 

1. **Circle Description**: The circle is centered at (-1.7, 1.6) with a radius of 4.0. 

2. **Line Segment from (0.6, -0.6) to (-1.1, -1.4)**: 
   - We'll first calculate the intersection of this line segment with the circle. 
   - Substitute the parameterization of the line segment into the equation of the circle and check for solutions.

3. **Line Segment from (0.9, 3.4) to (2.5, 1.2)**:
