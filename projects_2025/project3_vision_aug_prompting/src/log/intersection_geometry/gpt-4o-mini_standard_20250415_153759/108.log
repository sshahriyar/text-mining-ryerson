problem: There is a polygon with coordinates [(-0.5, -6.1), (3.1, -2.5), (0.3, 2.0), (-4.7, 3.7), (-4.6, -3.1)]. There is a polygon with coordinates [(6.1, -0.3), (0.8, 2.9), (-1.7, -2.1), (2.1, -5.1)]. There is a polygon with coordinates [(4.2, 5.1), (-1.7, 3.3), (-1.9, -1.5), (3.9, -2.2)]. There is a polygon with coordinates [(-3.3, 0.3), (0.8, -2.1), (2.9, 1.2), (4.0, 5.7), (-2.6, 5.5)]. How many intersection points are there?
result: To find the number of intersection points between multiple polygons, we need to check whether the edges of the polygons intersect each other. The process can be quite complex, especially with multiple polygons. 

For this specific input, we have four polygons. To determine intersection points, here's a systematic approach:

1. **Identify pairs of polygons**: We will consider each polygon and compare it with every other polygon to check for intersections.

2. **Check for edge intersections**: For each pair of polygons, check all edges of the first polygon against all edges of the second polygon to see if they intersect.

3. **Count unique intersections**: If two segments intersect, ensure that the intersection point is counted only once, even if multiple edges intersect at the same
