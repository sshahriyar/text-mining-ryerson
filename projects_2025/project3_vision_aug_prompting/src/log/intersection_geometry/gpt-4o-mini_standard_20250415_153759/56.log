========================================
problem: There is a line segment from (-1.1, -3.4) to (1.3, 0.3). There is a circle centered at (-0.7, 1.3) with radius 2.0. There is a line segment from (2.5, 3.1) to (1.1, 2.8). How many intersection points are there?
result: To find the number of intersection points between the given shapes and lines, we need to analyze the relationships between the circle, the polygon, and the line segments.

### Given:
1. **Circle**: Center = (-0.7, 1.3) and Radius = 2.0.
2. **Line Segment 1**: From (-1.1, -3.4) to (1.3, 0.3).
3. **Line Segment 2**: From (2.5, 3.1) to (1.1, 2.8).

### Steps to Determine Intersections:

1. **Circle and Line Segment 1**:
