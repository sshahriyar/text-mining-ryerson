========================================
problem: There is a line segment from (0.1, -0.1) to (0.6, 1.1). There is a polygon with coordinates [(-2.9, -0.8), (2.2, -0.2), (-2.1, 5.6)]. How many intersection points are there?
result: To determine the number of intersection points between the given line segment and the polygon defined by its vertices, we need to check if the line segment intersects with any of the edges of the polygon.

1. The polygon has three vertices: 
   - A = (-2.9, -0.8)
   - B = (2.2, -0.2)
   - C = (-2.1, 5.6)

2. We can represent the edges of the polygon as line segments:
   - Edge 1: AB from (-2.9, -0.8) to (2.2, -0.2)
   - Edge 2: BC from (2.2, -0.2)
