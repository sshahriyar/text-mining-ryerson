========================================
problem: There is a polygon with coordinates [(0.2, -3.4), (0.1, 3.5), (-5.6, -2.3)]. There is a circle centered at (-1.4, -0.4) with radius 1.0. There is a polygon with coordinates [(4.4, 2.8), (-2.2, 4.0), (-4.3, -1.1), (2.1, -3.6)]. There is a polygon with coordinates [(-1.1, -2.4), (2.0, 3.1), (-4.3, 3.1)]. How many intersection points are there?
result: To determine the number of intersection points between the specified shapes, we need to analyze the relationships between each shape:

1. **Circle Analysis**:
   - There is a circle centered at (-1.4, -0.4) with a radius of 1.0.
   - The equation of the circle is \((x + 1.4)^2 + (y + 0.4)^2 = 1\).

2. **Polygon Intersections**:
   - We have several polygons outlined with their respective coordinates:
     - Polygon 1: [(0.2, -3.4), (0.1, 3.5), (-5.6, -2.3)]
     - Polygon 2
