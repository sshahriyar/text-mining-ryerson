========================================
problem: There is a line segment from (2.0, 0.3) to (-0.3, -1.4). There is a line segment from (1.3, 2.3) to (-2.4, -2.3). How many intersection points are there?
result: To determine the number of intersection points between the two line segments defined by their endpoints, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the endpoints of the segments:**
   - The first line segment's endpoints are A(2.0, 0.3) and B(-0.3, -1.4).
   - The second line segment's endpoints are C(1.3, 2.3) and D(-2.4, -2.3).

2. **Calculate the direction vectors of each segment:**
   - For AB (the first segment): \( \vec{AB} = B - A = (-0.3 - 2.0, -1.4 - 0.3)
