problem: There is a polygon with coordinates [(0.7, -3.2), (3.6, 3.1), (-3.4, 1.6)]. There is a polygon with coordinates [(-1.8, -1.0), (2.9, -3.6), (4.6, 1.0), (-0.7, 4.0)]. There is a circle centered at (1.5, 1.0) with radius 1.0. There is a polygon with coordinates [(-2.4, -2.0), (1.7, -2.2), (1.6, 1.7), (-2.5, 3.2)]. How many intersection points are there?
result: To determine the number of intersection points for the shapes specified, we will analyze the intersections between the polygons and the circle.

1. **Intersection between the first polygon and the circle**:
   - The first polygon has vertices at coordinates [(0.7, -3.2), (3.6, 3.1), (-3.4, 1.6)].
   - The circle has a center at (1.5, 1.0) and a radius of 1.0. 

   We will check each edge of the polygon to see if it intersects with the circle. The intersection can occur if:
   - The distance from the center of the circle to the line segment (polygon edge) is less than
