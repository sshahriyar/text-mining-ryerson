========================================
problem: There is a circle centered at (-0.7, -2.0) with radius 2.0. There is a circle centered at (0.0, -0.3) with radius 3.0. There is a polygon with coordinates [(2.2, -4.0), (-1.3, 2.8), (-6.1, -4.7)]. There is a circle centered at (-0.4, -0.5) with radius 4.0. How many intersection points are there?
result: To find the number of intersection points between the specified shapes, we will analyze the intersections between the circles, the polygon, and the coordinates provided.

1. **Circle centered at (-0.7, -2.0) with radius 2.0**: 
   - Equation: \((x + 0.7)^2 + (y + 2.0)^2 = 2.0^2\)

2. **Circle centered at (0.0, -0.3) with radius 3.0**: 
   - Equation: \(x^2 + (y + 0.3)^2 = 3.0^2\)

3. **Polygon with coordinates [(2.2,
