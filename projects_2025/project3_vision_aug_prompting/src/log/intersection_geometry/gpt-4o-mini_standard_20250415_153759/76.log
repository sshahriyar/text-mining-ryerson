========================================
problem: There is a polygon with coordinates [(-1.2, -3.3), (3.4, 0.2), (1.4, 4.6), (-2.7, 3.7), (-3.9, 0.3)]. There is a circle centered at (-0.1, 0.5) with radius 1.0. There is a circle centered at (-0.0, -1.7) with radius 4.0. How many intersection points are there?
result: To find the number of intersection points between the specified shapes, we need to analyze the interactions between the polygon and the two circles.

1. **First Circle (Center: (-0.1, 0.5), Radius: 1.0)**:
   - We will investigate the distances from the vertices of the polygon to the center of the circle to see if they lie within the radius.
   - Distance Formula: 
     \[
     d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
     \]
   - Polygon vertices:
     - Vertex 1: (-1.2, -3.3)
     - Vertex 2: (3.
