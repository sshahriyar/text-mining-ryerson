========================================
problem: There is a polygon with coordinates [(-3.2, -4.3), (1.2, -5.1), (3.7, -1.1), (-0.1, 2.3), (-3.8, -0.6)]. There is a polygon with coordinates [(0.1, 3.4), (-3.7, 0.0), (-0.8, -4.1), (4.0, -1.4)]. How many intersection points are there?
result: To determine the number of intersection points between the two polygons specified by their coordinates, we need to examine their edges. 

1. The first polygon consists of the following vertices:
   - A1: (-3.2, -4.3)
   - A2: (1.2, -5.1)
   - A3: (3.7, -1.1)
   - A4: (-0.1, 2.3)
   - A5: (-3.8, -0.6)

   By connecting these points, we can outline the edges:
   - Edge A1-A2
   - Edge A2-A3
   - Edge A3-A4
   - Edge A
