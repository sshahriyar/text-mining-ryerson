problem: There is a line segment from (1.7, -2.0) to (1.4, -0.2). There is a line segment from (3.6, -0.4) to (2.1, -3.6). There is a line segment from (0.6, 2.6) to (-2.9, -0.8). How many intersection points are there?
result: To determine the number of intersection points between the specified line segments, let's analyze them.

1. **Line Segment 1**: From (1.7, -2.0) to (1.4, -0.2)
2. **Line Segment 2**: From (3.6, -0.4) to (2.1, -3.6)
3. **Line Segment 3**: From (0.6, 2.6) to (-2.9, -0.8)

To check for intersections between segments, we can use the orientation method:

- Calculate the orientation of the triplets of points to determine if segments intersect.
- Segment AB from (x1, y1
