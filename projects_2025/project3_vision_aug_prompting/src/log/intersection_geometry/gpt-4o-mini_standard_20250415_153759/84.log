========================================
problem: There is a polygon with coordinates [(1.8, 2.2), (-2.9, 0.9), (-4.8, -3.4), (1.7, -4.7)]. There is a polygon with coordinates [(5.3, -2.2), (0.7, 4.6), (-1.5, -1.5)]. There is a circle centered at (-1.5, 1.0) with radius 3.0. There is a circle centered at (1.7, -0.1) with radius 2.0. How many intersection points are there?
result: To determine the number of intersection points among the given shapes and lines, we need to analyze their positions and how they interact with each other. Here's the detailed breakdown of the provided input:

1. **First Polygon:** 
   - Coordinates: [(1.8, 2.2), (-2.9, 0.9), (-4.8, -3.4), (1.7, -4.7)]

2. **Second Polygon:**
   - Coordinates: [(5.3, -2.2), (0.7, 4.6), (-1.5, -1.5)]

3. **First Circle:**
   - Center: (-1.5, 1.0)
