========================================
problem: There is a circle centered at (0.8, -1.9) with radius 3.0. There is a circle centered at (1.5, 1.5) with radius 3.0. How many intersection points are there?
result: To determine the number of intersection points between the two circles, we need to find out how they relate to one another based on their centers and radii.

1. **Circle 1** has the center \((0.8, -1.9)\) and radius \(3.0\).
2. **Circle 2** has the center \((1.5, 1.5)\) and radius \(3.0\).

Next, we calculate the distance \(d\) between the centers of the two circles:

\[
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]

In this case:

- \(x_1 =
