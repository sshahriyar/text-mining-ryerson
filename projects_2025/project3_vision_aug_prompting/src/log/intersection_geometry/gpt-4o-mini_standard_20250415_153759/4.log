========================================
problem: There is a polygon with coordinates [(5.9, -0.5), (-0.8, 1.7), (-3.5, -3.3), (1.2, -5.3)]. There is a circle centered at (-1.0, -0.4) with radius 3.0. How many intersection points are there?
result: To find the number of intersection points between the specified polygon and the circle, we will follow these steps:

1. **Define the Circle**:
   The equation of the circle centered at (-1.0, -0.4) with a radius of 3.0 can be expressed as:
   \[
   (x + 1.0)^2 + (y + 0.4)^2 = 3.0^2
   \]
   which simplifies to:
   \[
   (x + 1.0)^2 + (y + 0.4)^2 = 9.0
   \]

2. **Define the Polygon**:
   The vertices of the polygon are given by the coordinates
