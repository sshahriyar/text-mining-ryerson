========================================
problem: There is a polygon with coordinates [(-1.3, -1.0), (4.1, 0.3), (-0.1, 4.5), (-5.4, 2.5)]. There is a line segment from (1.8, 3.6) to (3.9, -3.9). There is a line segment from (3.2, -1.4) to (-0.4, -0.3). There is a polygon with coordinates [(-4.1, -3.8), (0.8, -3.1), (4.2, -0.2), (-0.2, 4.5), (-3.5, 0.9)]. How many intersection points are there?
result: To determine the number of intersection points between the shapes (polygons and line segments) specified in the input, we will consider each shape and line segment provided.

1. **First Polygon**: The coordinates are [(-1.3, -1.0), (4.1, 0.3), (-0.1, 4.5), (-5.4, 2.5)].
2. **First Line Segment**: From (1.8, 3.6) to (3.9, -3.9).
3. **Second Line Segment**: From (3.2, -1.4) to (-0.4, -0.3).
4. **Second Polygon**
