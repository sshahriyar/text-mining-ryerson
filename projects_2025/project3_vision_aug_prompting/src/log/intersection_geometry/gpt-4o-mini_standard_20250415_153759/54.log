========================================
problem: There is a line segment from (-1.1, 2.1) to (-0.5, -1.1). There is a circle centered at (-0.3, 1.0) with radius 2.0. There is a circle centered at (1.3, 1.7) with radius 1.0. How many intersection points are there?
result: To find the number of intersection points between the specified line segment and the two circles, we'll analyze both cases.

### Step 1: Line Segment from (-1.1, 2.1) to (-0.5, -1.1)
First, we determine the equation of the line segment. 

The direction vector of the line segment can be derived from the coordinates:
- Starting point: A = (-1.1, 2.1)
- Ending point: B = (-0.5, -1.1)

The vector \( \vec{AB} \) is \( (-0.5 - (-1.1), -1.1 - 2.1) = (0.6, -3.
