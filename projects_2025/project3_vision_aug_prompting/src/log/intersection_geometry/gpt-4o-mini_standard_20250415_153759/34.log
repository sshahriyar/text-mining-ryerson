========================================
problem: There is a line segment from (3.3, -3.7) to (-0.3, 0.3). There is a polygon with coordinates [(2.2, -1.8), (5.0, 2.5), (1.5, 6.2), (-4.2, 2.8), (-2.1, -3.4)]. How many intersection points are there?
result: To determine the number of intersection points between a line segment and a polygon defined by its vertices, it's necessary to check for intersections between the line segment and each edge of the polygon. Here's a breakdown of how to approach the problem:

1. **Identify the Line Segment**:
   - Start point: (3.3, -3.7)
   - End point: (-0.3, 0.3)

2. **Identify the Polygon Edges**:
   The polygon has the following vertices:
   - (2.2, -1.8)
   - (5.0, 2.5)
   - (1.5, 6.2)
   - (-4.2, 2.8
