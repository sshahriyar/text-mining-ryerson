========================================
problem: There is a line segment from (-0.9, -0.1) to (-2.7, 3.3). There is a line segment from (-1.0, 3.7) to (2.8, -2.7). How many intersection points are there?
result: To determine the number of intersection points between the specified line segments, we need to analyze their equations and check if they intersect.

Let's denote the first line segment as \( L_1 \) defined by the points \( A(-0.9, -0.1) \) and \( B(-2.7, 3.3) \), and the second line segment as \( L_2 \) defined by the points \( C(-1.0, 3.7) \) and \( D(2.8, -2.7) \).

First, we can find the equations for these line segments.

### For \( L_1 \):
