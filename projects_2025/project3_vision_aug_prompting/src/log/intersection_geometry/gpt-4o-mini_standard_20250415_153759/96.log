problem: There is a circle centered at (1.7, 0.3) with radius 1.0. There is a line segment from (0.3, -0.1) to (-2.8, 3.5). There is a circle centered at (0.2, -1.3) with radius 2.0. There is a circle centered at (-0.9, 1.4) with radius 2.0. How many intersection points are there?
result: To determine the number of intersection points between the given shapes (circles and line segments), we can analyze each pair of geometric objects involved. Let's perform a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Circle at (1.7, 0.3) with radius 1.0:** 
   - This circle will intersect with other shapes based on their positions.

2. **Line segment from (0.3, -0.1) to (-2.8, 3.5):** 
   - We will see how many times this line segment intersects with the first circle.

3. **Circle at (0.2, -1.3) with radius 2.0:**
   - We will determine intersection points with
