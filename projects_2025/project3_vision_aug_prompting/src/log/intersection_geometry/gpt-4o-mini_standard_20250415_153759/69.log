========================================
problem: There is a polygon with coordinates [(-1.2, 1.1), (-1.8, -6.6), (6.2, -2.0)]. There is a circle centered at (-1.8, 0.6) with radius 2.0. There is a line segment from (0.3, -3.7) to (-3.3, -2.9). How many intersection points are there?
result: To determine the number of intersection points based on the provided shapes, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Circle and Polygon**: Check for intersection points between the circle and the vertices of the polygon. Since the polygon is defined by a set of vertices, we can also check for intersection points between the circle and the edges of the polygon.

2. **Circle and Line Segment**: Check if the line segment intersects the circle. This involves finding the points on the circle's circumference that are closest to the line segment and checking if they lie within the segment.

3. **Polygon Edges and Line Segments**: Since the polygon has edges defined by each pair of consecutive vertices, check for intersection points between these edges and the line segment defined from
