problem: There is a circle centered at (1.1, 0.1) with radius 3.0. There is a line segment from (-1.0, 3.3) to (1.0, -2.2). How many intersection points are there?
result: To determine the number of intersection points between the given circle and the line segment, we can use the geometric properties of circles and lines.

1. **Circle Equation:** The equation of the circle centered at (1.1, 0.1) with radius 3.0 is given by:
   \[
   (x - 1.1)^2 + (y - 0.1)^2 = 3.0^2
   \]
   or
   \[
   (x - 1.1)^2 + (y - 0.1)^2 = 9.
   \]

2. **Line Segment Equation:** The line segment from (-1.0, 3.3) to (
