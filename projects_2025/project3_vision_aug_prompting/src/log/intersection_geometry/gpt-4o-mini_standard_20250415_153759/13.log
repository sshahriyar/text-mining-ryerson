========================================
problem: There is a circle centered at (1.4, -0.6) with radius 2.0. There is a polygon with coordinates [(-3.1, -3.9), (4.4, -1.2), (-1.1, 1.0)]. How many intersection points are there?
result: To determine the number of intersection points, we need to analyze the relationships between the circle, polygon, and line segment provided in the step.

1. **Circle**: The circle is centered at (1.4, -0.6) with a radius of 2.0. The equation of the circle can be expressed as:
   \[
   (x - 1.4)^2 + (y + 0.6)^2 = 2^2
   \]
   or 
   \[
   (x - 1.4)^2 + (y + 0.6)^2 = 4
   \]

2. **Polygon**: The polygon is defined by the vertices [(-3.
