problem: There is a line segment from (-0.4, 0.7) to (-2.9, -0.3). There is a line segment from (-0.2, -0.8) to (-1.2, 3.6). How many intersection points are there?
result: To determine the number of intersection points between the two line segments given:

1. The first line segment is defined by the endpoints (-0.4, 0.7) and (-2.9, -0.3).
2. The second line segment is defined by the endpoints (-0.2, -0.8) and (-1.2, 3.6).

We can find the equations of both line segments and check if they intersect.

**1. Finding the equations of the line segments:**

For the first line segment:
- Let point A = (-0.4, 0.7) and point B = (-2.9, -0.3).
- The slope (m1) can be calculated
