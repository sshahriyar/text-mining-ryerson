========================================
problem: There is a circle centered at (-0.8, 1.7) with radius 4.0. There is a circle centered at (0.5, -1.8) with radius 1.0. There is a polygon with coordinates [(-3.5, -3.5), (2.3, -1.1), (-1.9, 2.8)]. There is a line segment from (1.9, 1.1) to (-3.3, 3.5). How many intersection points are there?
result: To determine the number of intersection points between the described geometric shapes, we will analyze how each shape interacts with the others.

1. **Circles**:
   - The first circle is centered at \((-0.8, 1.7)\) with a radius of \(4.0\).
   - The second circle is centered at \((0.5, -1.8)\) with a radius of \(1.0\).

   To find the intersection points between the circles, we need to calculate the distance \(d\) between their centers:
   \[
   d = \sqrt{((-0.8 - 0.5)^2) + ((1.7 - (-1.8))^2)}
