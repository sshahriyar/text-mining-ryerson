========================================
problem: There is a circle centered at (-0.2, -0.3) with radius 3.0. There is a polygon with coordinates [(1.4, -3.9), (1.8, 1.2), (-4.4, -0.8)]. How many intersection points are there?
result: To determine the number of intersection points between the given shapes (the circle and polygon) described in your input, we will analyze the scenario step by step.

1. **Circle Details**:
   - Center: (-0.2, -0.3)
   - Radius: 3.0

   The equation of the circle is given by 
   \((x + 0.2)^2 + (y + 0.3)^2 = 3^2\).

2. **Polygon Details**:
   The polygon is defined by the coordinates: 
   - (1.4, -3.9)
   - (1.8, 1.2)
   - (-4.4, -0.
