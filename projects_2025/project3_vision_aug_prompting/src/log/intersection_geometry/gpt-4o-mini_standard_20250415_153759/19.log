========================================
problem: There is a circle centered at (-1.5, 1.4) with radius 2.0. There is a line segment from (-1.6, 3.5) to (3.0, -0.9). How many intersection points are there?
result: To find the number of intersection points between the specified shapes, let's analyze the given inputs one by one.

1. **Circle Definition**:
   - Center: (-1.5, 1.4)
   - Radius: 2.0

   The equation of the circle can be written as:
   \[
   (x + 1.5)^2 + (y - 1.4)^2 = 2^2
   \]
   or
   \[
   (x + 1.5)^2 + (y - 1.4)^2 = 4
   \]

2. **Line Segment Definition**:
   - Start Point: (-1.6, 3.5)
