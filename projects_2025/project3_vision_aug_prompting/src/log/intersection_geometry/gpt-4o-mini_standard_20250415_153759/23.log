problem: There is a line segment from (1.4, 0.3) to (-2.9, -0.1). There is a line segment from (2.8, -3.0) to (3.2, -1.7). How many intersection points are there?
result: To determine the number of intersection points between the two specified line segments, we need to analyze their endpoints and check if they intersect.

The two line segments defined by the given endpoints are:
1. Line segment A from (1.4, 0.3) to (-2.9, -0.1).
2. Line segment B from (2.8, -3.0) to (3.2, -1.7).

We can denote the endpoints of these line segments as follows:
- A1 = (1.4, 0.3), A2 = (-2.9, -0.1)
- B1 = (2.8, -3.0), B2 = (3.
