========================================
problem: There is a polygon with coordinates [(-5.2, -2.2), (1.3, -2.9), (0.0, 3.5)]. There is a polygon with coordinates [(3.4, -1.8), (-0.4, 5.0), (-4.7, 0.6), (-2.6, -3.9)]. How many intersection points are there?
result: To determine the number of intersection points between the two polygons, we need to analyze their edges and check for intersections.

1. **First Polygon Edges:**
   - Edge 1: from (-5.2, -2.2) to (1.3, -2.9)
   - Edge 2: from (1.3, -2.9) to (0.0, 3.5)
   - Edge 3: from (0.0, 3.5) to (-5.2, -2.2)

2. **Second Polygon Edges:**
   - Edge 1: from (3.4, -1.8) to (-0.4, 5
