========================================
problem: There is a line segment from (-0.6, 3.5) to (1.7, -0.1). There is a circle centered at (0.9, 0.6) with radius 1.0. There is a line segment from (-0.2, 1.7) to (-2.8, 3.0). How many intersection points are there?
result: To find the number of intersection points between the specified shapes and lines, we'll analyze the intersection of the line segment with the circle, and then check for intersections with the other line segment.

1. **Circle Equation**: The equation of the circle centered at (0.9, 0.6) with radius 1.0 is:
   \[
   (x - 0.9)^2 + (y - 0.6)^2 = 1.0^2
   \]

2. **Line Segment Equation**: The line segment from (-0.6, 3.5) to (1.7, -0.1) can be parameterized. Let's calculate the slope and create the equation of
