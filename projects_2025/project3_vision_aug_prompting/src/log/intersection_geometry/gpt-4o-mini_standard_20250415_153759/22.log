========================================
problem: There is a polygon with coordinates [(3.5, 2.9), (-3.7, -0.6), (4.3, -3.6)]. There is a line segment from (0.9, 2.7) to (-2.6, -0.7). How many intersection points are there?
result: To determine the number of intersection points for the given shapes and line segment, we need to analyze the geometry of the polygon and the line segment.

### Polygon vertices:
1. (3.5, 2.9)
2. (-3.7, -0.6)
3. (4.3, -3.6)

### Line segment endpoints:
- Start: (0.9, 2.7)
- End: (-2.6, -0.7)

### Steps:
1. **Check for intersections between the line segment and the edges of the polygon.** 
   - The polygon has 3 edges formed by connecting the vertices in order.

#### Edges of the Polygon:
- **Edge 1
