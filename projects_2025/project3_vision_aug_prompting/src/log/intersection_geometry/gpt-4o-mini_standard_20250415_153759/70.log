========================================
problem: There is a polygon with coordinates [(-3.1, 1.6), (-2.9, -5.0), (1.6, -2.1)]. There is a circle centered at (-1.6, 0.1) with radius 3.0. There is a circle centered at (1.0, -0.8) with radius 3.0. How many intersection points are there?
result: To find the number of intersection points among the specified shapes, we need to consider the polygon and the circles, checking for intersection points between each shape.

1. **Polygon:** Given the vertices are [(-3.1, 1.6), (-2.9, -5.0), (1.6, -2.1)], we can determine its edges to check for intersections with the circles.

2. **Circle 1:** Centered at (-1.6, 0.1) with radius 3.0.
3. **Circle 2:** Centered at (1.0, -0.8) with radius 3.0.

### Step 1: Check intersections between the circles
