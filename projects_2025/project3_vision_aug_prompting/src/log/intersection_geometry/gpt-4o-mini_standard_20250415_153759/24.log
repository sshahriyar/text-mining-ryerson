========================================
problem: There is a line segment from (0.5, 2.6) to (2.4, -1.8). There is a polygon with coordinates [(3.7, 1.9), (-1.8, 5.4), (-5.6, 2.2), (-1.0, -1.7)]. How many intersection points are there?
result: To find the number of intersection points between the line segment and the polygon, we need to check if the line segment intersects any of the edges of the polygon.

1. **Define the line segment**: The given line segment spans from (0.5, 2.6) to (2.4, -1.8).
   
2. **Define the polygon edges**:
   - The polygon has vertices at coordinates [(3.7, 1.9), (-1.8, 5.4), (-5.6, 2.2), (-1.0, -1.7)].
   - The edges of the polygon are:
     - Edge 1: (3.7, 1.
