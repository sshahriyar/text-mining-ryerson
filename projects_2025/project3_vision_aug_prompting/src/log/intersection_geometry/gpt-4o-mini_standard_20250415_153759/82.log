problem: There is a polygon with coordinates [(-3.2, -3.7), (3.4, -4.4), (0.7, 0.4), (-3.1, 0.1)]. There is a polygon with coordinates [(-0.1, -4.3), (3.1, 1.4), (-2.6, 2.9)]. There is a circle centered at (-1.1, 0.5) with radius 2.0. There is a polygon with coordinates [(-3.1, 3.2), (-3.9, -2.1), (-0.0, -3.3), (3.9, 1.2)]. How many intersection points are there?
result: To determine the number of intersection points among the specified geometrical shapes, we'll analyze them individually:

1. **First polygon** with coordinates **[(-3.2, -3.7), (3.4, -4.4), (0.7, 0.4), (-3.1, 0.1)]**:
   - There are 4 line segments formed between adjacent vertices. To find intersections, we would check all pairs of segments.

2. **Second polygon** with coordinates **[(-0.1, -4.3), (3.1, 1.4), (-2.6, 2.9)]**:
   - Similarly, this polygon has 3 sides, and
