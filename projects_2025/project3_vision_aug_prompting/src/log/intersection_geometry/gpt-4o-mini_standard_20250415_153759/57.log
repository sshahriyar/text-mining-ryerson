problem: There is a circle centered at (1.4, 0.5) with radius 4.0. There is a circle centered at (1.1, 0.6) with radius 4.0. There is a line segment from (1.1, -2.7) to (-3.1, 3.0). How many intersection points are there?
result: To determine the number of intersection points between the specified shapes and lines, we can analyze the given geometric figures.

1. **Circles**:
   - Circle 1: Centered at (1.4, 0.5) with radius 4.0.
   - Circle 2: Centered at (1.1, 0.6) with radius 4.0.

   To find out how many intersection points exist between two circles, we find the distance \( d \) between their centers:
   - Distance between centers:
     \[
     d = \sqrt{(1.4 - 1.1)^2 + (0.5 - 0.6)^2} = \sqrt{(
