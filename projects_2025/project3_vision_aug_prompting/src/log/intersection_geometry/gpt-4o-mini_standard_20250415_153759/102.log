problem: There is a circle centered at (-0.5, 1.5) with radius 3.0. There is a polygon with coordinates [(-2.1, 1.5), (1.3, -5.8), (4.5, 0.2)]. There is a polygon with coordinates [(4.4, -2.5), (2.0, 3.2), (-1.9, -1.9)]. There is a circle centered at (-1.8, -1.9) with radius 2.0. How many intersection points are there?
result: To find the number of intersection points among the given shapes (circles and polygons), we will analyze each pair of shapes.

1. **Circle 1**: Centered at (-0.5, 1.5) with radius 3.0.
2. **Polygon 1**: Coordinates [(-2.1, 1.5), (1.3, -5.8), (4.5, 0.2)].
3. **Polygon 2**: Coordinates [(4.4, -2.5), (2.0, 3.2), (-1.9, -1.9)].
4. **Circle 2**: Centered at (-1.8,
