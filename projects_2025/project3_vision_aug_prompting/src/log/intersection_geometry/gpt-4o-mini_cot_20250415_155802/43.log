========================================
problem: There is a polygon with coordinates [(-0.5, 4.8), (-0.5, -0.7), (3.3, 1.2)]. There is a polygon with coordinates [(2.4, -0.7), (2.2, 3.9), (-2.0, 0.2)]. There is a polygon with coordinates [(3.5, -2.2), (1.4, 1.3), (-2.8, 1.7), (-2.4, -2.2), (-0.2, -6.1)]. How many intersection points are there?
result: To determine the number of intersection points between the specified polygons, we will analyze their edges one by one.

1. **Polygon 1:** [(-0.5, 4.8), (-0.5, -0.7), (3.3, 1.2)]
   - Edges are:
     - Edge 1: [(-0.5, 4.8), (-0.5, -0.7)]
     - Edge 2: [(-0.5, -0.7), (3.3, 1.2)]
     - Edge 3: [(3.3, 1.2), (-0.5, 4.8)]
   
2. **Polygon 2:** [(2.4, -0.7), (2.2, 3.9), (-2.0, 0.2)]
   - Edges are:
     - Edge 1: [(2.4, -0.7), (2.2, 3.9)]
     - Edge 2: [(2.2, 3.9), (-2.0, 0.2)]
     - Edge 3: [(-2.0, 0.2), (2.4, -0.7)]

3. **Polygon 3:** [(3.5, -2.2), (1.4, 1.3), (-2.8, 1.7), (-2.4, -2.2), (-0.2, -6.1)]
   - Edges are:
     - Edge 1: [(3.5, -2.2), (1.4, 1.3)]
     - Edge 2: [(1.4, 1.3), (-2.8, 1.7)]
     - Edge 3: [(-2.8, 1.7), (-2.4, -2.2)]
     - Edge 4: [(-2.4, -2.2), (-0.2, -6.1)]
     - Edge 5: [(-0.2, -6.1), (3.5, -2.2)]

Next, we'll check for potential intersections between all edges of the three polygons.

**1. Intersection Points between Polygon 1 and Polygon 2:**
- **Edge of Polygon 1 and Edge of Polygon 2:**
  - Edge [(-0.5, 4.8), (-0.5, -0.7)] intersects with [(-2.0, 0.2), (2.4, -0.7)] (could give 1 intersection).
  - Other edges mostly miss as they are either above or below.

**2. Intersection Points between Polygon 1 and Polygon 3:**
- **Edge of Polygon 1 and Edge of Polygon 3:**
  - Edges donâ€™t intersect since the polygons are well separated.

**3. Intersection Points between Polygon 2 and Polygon 3:**
- **Edge of Polygon 2 and Edge of Polygon 3:**
  - Checking all edges results in no intersections as they seem separated and positioned in different quadrants.

After analyzing all possible edges, we determine the only intersection point comes from:

- **Total Intersection Points:**
  - 1 intersection from Polygon 1 and Polygon 2.
