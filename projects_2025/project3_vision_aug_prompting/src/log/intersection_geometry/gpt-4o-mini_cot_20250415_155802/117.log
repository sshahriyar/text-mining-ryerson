========================================
problem: There is a circle centered at (0.4, 0.9) with radius 2.0. There is a line segment from (-0.9, 3.2) to (-1.6, 3.8). There is a circle centered at (0.2, -2.0) with radius 2.0. There is a line segment from (1.5, -0.6) to (-3.2, 3.8). How many intersection points are there?
result: To find the number of intersection points between the specified shapes and lines, we will analyze each pair of shapes and lines one by one.

1. **Circle 1**: Centered at (0.4, 0.9) with radius 2.0
   - **Line Segment 1**: From (-0.9, 3.2) to (-1.6, 3.8)
     - To determine if they intersect, we calculate the line segment equation and check if the distance from the center of the circle to the line is less than the radius.
     - Upon solving, it turns out that this line segment does not intersect with Circle 1. **(0 intersections)**.

2. **Circle 2**: Centered at (0.2, -2.0) with radius 2.0
   - **Line Segment 2**: From (1.5, -0.6) to (-3.2, 3.8)
     - Applying the line intersection check, we find that this line segment intersects Circle 2 at two points. **(2 intersections)**.

Thus, total intersections are:
- Circle 1 and Line Segment 1: 0
- Circle 2 and Line Segment 2: 2

Summing these intersection counts gives us a total of **2 intersection points**.

**Output: 2**
