========================================
problem: There is a circle centered at (1.4, 0.5) with radius 4.0. There is a circle centered at (1.1, 0.6) with radius 4.0. There is a line segment from (1.1, -2.7) to (-3.1, 3.0). How many intersection points are there?
result: To find the number of intersection points between the given geometric shapes, we will analyze the provided input step by step.

1. **Circles Intersection**: 

   - **Circle 1**: Center = (1.4, 0.5), Radius = 4.0
   - **Circle 2**: Center = (1.1, 0.6), Radius = 4.0

   Two circles will intersect at most at two points if they are close enough but not identical. The distance between their centers can be calculated as:
   \[
   d = \sqrt{(1.4 - 1.1)^2 + (0.5 - 0.6)^2} = \sqrt{(0.3)^2 + (-0.1)^2} = \sqrt{0.09 + 0.01} = \sqrt{0.1} \approx 0.316
   \]

   Since the distance \(d \approx 0.316\) is less than the sum of the radii (8.0), the circles intersect at two points.
   
2. **Circle and Line Segment Intersection**:

   The line segment coordinates are (1.1, -2.7) to (-3.1, 3.0). To analyze the line segment:
   
   - The equation of the line can be derived from the endpoints. The slope \(m\) is given by:
   \[
   m = \frac{3.0 - (-2.7)}{-3.1 - 1.1} = \frac{5.7}{-4.2} \approx -1.357
   \]

   - The y-intercept \(b\) can be found using one of the points:
   \[
   3.0 = -1.357(-3.1) + b \implies b \approx 0.67
   \]

   - The line equation is approximately \(y = -1.357x + 0.67\). To find intersections with Circle 1 (and Circle 2), we substitute \(y\) into the circle equations and solve for \(x\). After solving, we find that there are no real intersections between the line segment and either circle.

3. **Intersection Between Circles**:

   - We already established that Circle 1 and Circle 2 intersect at two points.

4. **Summary of Findings**:
   - **Circles**: 2 intersection points
   - **Circle 1 and Line Segment**: 0 intersection points
   - **Circle 2 and Line Segment**: 0 intersection points

Based on this analysis, the total number of intersection points is:

**Output**:
