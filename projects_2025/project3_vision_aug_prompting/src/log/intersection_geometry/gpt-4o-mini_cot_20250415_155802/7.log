========================================
problem: There is a circle centered at (-0.5, 1.6) with radius 2.0. There is a circle centered at (0.4, -0.7) with radius 4.0. How many intersection points are there?
result: To determine the number of intersection points between the two circles, we need to analyze their relationships based on their centers and radii.

1. The first circle, \(C_1\), is centered at \((-0.5, 1.6)\) with a radius of \(2.0\).
2. The second circle, \(C_2\), is centered at \((0.4, -0.7)\) with a radius of \(4.0\).

First, we calculate the distance between the centers of the two circles:

- The distance between the centers \(d\) can be calculated using the distance formula:
\[
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]
where \((x_1, y_1) = (-0.5, 1.6)\) and \((x_2, y_2) = (0.4, -0.7)\).

Calculating the distance:
\[
d = \sqrt{(0.4 - (-0.5))^2 + (-0.7 - 1.6)^2}
\]
\[
= \sqrt{(0.4 + 0.5)^2 + (-0.7 - 1.6)^2}
\]
\[
= \sqrt{(0.9)^2 + (-2.3)^2}
\]
\[
= \sqrt{0.81 + 5.29} = \sqrt{6.1} \approx 2.47
\]

Next, we analyze the possible intersections based on the distances and radii:

1. Two circles will have:
   - 0 intersection points if \(d > r_1 + r_2\) (the circles are too far apart),
   - 1 intersection point if \(d = r_1 + r_2\) (the circles are externally tangent),
   - 2 intersection points if \(r_1 - r_2 < d < r_1 + r_2\) (the circles intersect),
   - 0 intersection points if \(d < |r_1 - r_2|\) (one circle is inside the other without touching).

Using the radii of the circles:
- \(r_1 = 2.0\)
- \(r_2 = 4.0\)

Calculating \(r_1 + r_2 = 2.0 + 4.0 = 6.0\) and \(|r_1 - r_2| = |2.0 - 4.0| = 2.0\).

Now, we compare \(d\) with \(r_1 + r_2\) and \(|r_1 - r_2|\):
- \(d \approx 2.47 < 6.0\) (the circles are not too far apart).
- \(d \approx 2.47 > 2.0\) (the circles do not lie completely inside each other).

Since \(r_1 - r_2 < d < r_1 + r_2\), the two circles intersect at two distinct points.

Thus, the answer is:
