========================================
problem: There is a line segment from (1.4, 0.3) to (-2.9, -0.1). There is a line segment from (2.8, -3.0) to (3.2, -1.7). How many intersection points are there?
result: To determine the number of intersection points between the given line segments, we will analyze them based on their coordinates:

1. Line Segment A from (1.4, 0.3) to (-2.9, -0.1).
2. Line Segment B from (2.8, -3.0) to (3.2, -1.7).

### Step 1: Find the equations of the line segments.

For Line Segment A:
- The slope \( m_A \) can be calculated as:
  \[
  m_A = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{-0.1 - 0.3}{-2.9 - 1.4} = \frac{-0.4}{-4.3} \approx 0.093
  \]

- The equation of the line can be represented as:
  \[
  y - y_1 = m_A (x - x_1) \implies y - 0.3 = 0.093 (x - 1.4)
  \]

For Line Segment B:
- The slope \( m_B \) can be calculated as:
  \[
  m_B = \frac{-1.7 - (-3.0)}{3.2 - 2.8} = \frac{1.3}{0.4} = 3.25
  \]

- The equation for this segment can be represented as:
  \[
  y - (-3.0) = 3.25 (x - 2.8)
  \]

### Step 2: Solve the equations for intersection points.

To find the intersection points, we will set the equations derived above equal to each other. 

1. Solve both equations for \(y\).
2. Set them equal to each other.
3. Find if there exists an \(x\) in the ranges of both segments.

### Step 3: Analysis of the segments' ranges.

- For Segment A:
  - \(x\) ranges from \(-2.9\) to \(1.4\).
- For Segment B:
  - \(x\) ranges from \(2.8\) to \(3.2\).

### Conclusion

Since the x-range of segment A (\(-2.9\) to \(1.4\)) does not overlap with the x-range of segment B (\(2.8\) to \(3.2\)), these segments do not intersect. Therefore, there are:

**0 intersection points.**
