========================================
problem: There is a line segment from (1.7, -2.0) to (1.4, -0.2). There is a line segment from (3.6, -0.4) to (2.1, -3.6). There is a line segment from (0.6, 2.6) to (-2.9, -0.8). How many intersection points are there?
result: To determine the number of intersection points between the given line segments, we will analyze each pair of segments to see if they intersect.

1. **Line Segment 1**: (1.7, -2.0) to (1.4, -0.2)  
2. **Line Segment 2**: (3.6, -0.4) to (2.1, -3.6)  
3. **Line Segment 3**: (0.6, 2.6) to (-2.9, -0.8)  

### Steps to Determine Intersections

**Checking Intersection Between Line Segment 1 and Line Segment 2:**
- Line Segment 1 starts at (1.7, -2.0) and ends at (1.4, -0.2).
- Line Segment 2 starts at (3.6, -0.4) and ends at (2.1, -3.6).
- The segments are in different vertical slices (x-coordinates), thus they do not intersect.

**Checking Intersection Between Line Segment 1 and Line Segment 3:**
- Line Segment 3 starts at (0.6, 2.6) and ends at (-2.9, -0.8).
- The y-coordinates for Line Segment 1 are negative and for Line Segment 3 are positive on their respective spans.
- The segments do not intersect since one is entirely in the negative y-region and the other in the positive.

**Checking Intersection Between Line Segment 2 and Line Segment 3:**
- The x-coordinates of Line Segment 2 run from 3.6 to 2.1, while Line Segment 3 runs from 0.6 to -2.9.
- Since Line Segment 2 is in the positive x-region and Line Segment 3 is in the negative x-region, they cannot intersect.

### Conclusion
Since none of the line segments intersect with each other, the total number of intersection points is:
