========================================
problem: There is a line segment from (3.3, -3.7) to (-0.3, 0.3). There is a polygon with coordinates [(2.2, -1.8), (5.0, 2.5), (1.5, 6.2), (-4.2, 2.8), (-2.1, -3.4)]. How many intersection points are there?
result: 1. line segment(1) and polygon(2): 
   - Checking line segment from (3.3, -3.7) to (-0.3, 0.3) with individual edges of the polygon:
     - Edge from (2.2, -1.8) to (5.0, 2.5): No intersection.
     - Edge from (5.0, 2.5) to (1.5, 6.2): No intersection.
     - Edge from (1.5, 6.2) to (-4.2, 2.8): No intersection.
     - Edge from (-4.2, 2.8) to (-2.1, -3.4): No intersection.
     - Edge from (-2.1, -3.4) to (2.2, -1.8): No intersection.

2. polygon(2) has no intersection with line segment(1).

Overall, there are 0 intersection points.
