========================================
problem: There is a circle centered at (0.8, -1.9) with radius 3.0. There is a circle centered at (1.5, 1.5) with radius 3.0. How many intersection points are there?
result: To find the number of intersection points between the two circles described, we need to analyze their positions based on their centers and radii.

1. **Circle 1**: Center at (0.8, -1.9) with radius 3.0.
   - The equation of Circle 1 is: 
     \[
     (x - 0.8)^2 + (y + 1.9)^2 = 3.0^2
     \]

2. **Circle 2**: Center at (1.5, 1.5) with radius 3.0.
   - The equation of Circle 2 is: 
     \[
     (x - 1.5)^2 + (y - 1.5)^2 = 3.0^2
     \]

Next, we calculate the distance \(d\) between the centers of the two circles, which is given by the distance formula:
\[
d = \sqrt{(1.5 - 0.8)^2 + (1.5 + 1.9)^2}
\]
Calculating this gives:
\[
d = \sqrt{(0.7)^2 + (3.4)^2} = \sqrt{0.49 + 11.56} = \sqrt{12.05} \approx 3.47
\]

The relationship between the distance \(d\) and the radii \(r_1\) and \(r_2\) will tell us how many intersection points there are:

- If \(d > r_1 + r_2\): No intersection points.
- If \(d = r_1 + r_2\): The circles touch at one point (tangential).
- If \(|r_1 - r_2| < d < r_1 + r_2\): Two intersection points.
- If \(d = |r_1 - r_2|\): The circles touch at one point (internally tangential).
- If \(d < |r_1 - r_2|\): No intersection points.

Here:
- \(r_1 + r_2 = 3.0 + 3.0 = 6.0\)
- \(|r_1 - r_2| = |3.0 - 3.0| = 0\)

Since \(3.47 < 6.0\), this means the circles intersect at two points.

Therefore, the number of intersection points between the two circles is **2**.
