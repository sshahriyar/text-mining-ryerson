problem: There is a line segment from (-1.1, 2.1) to (-0.5, -1.1). There is a circle centered at (-0.3, 1.0) with radius 2.0. There is a circle centered at (1.3, 1.7) with radius 1.0. How many intersection points are there?
result: To find the number of intersection points between the specified line segment and the two circles, we will analyze each case:

1. **Line Segment and Circle 1** (centered at (-0.3, 1.0) with radius 2.0):
   - The line segment endpoints are (-1.1, 2.1) and (-0.5, -1.1).
   - We need to determine if this line segment intersects the circle. 
   - We compute the distances of the endpoints from the circle's center and check if these distances compared to the circle's radius might yield any intersection.
   - If the line segment passes through the area bounded by the circle, we can ascertain if it intersects the circle at one or two points.

2. **Line Segment and Circle 2** (centered at (1.3, 1.7) with radius 1.0):
   - We assess for intersections similarly by checking distances.
   - Since the line segment endpoints are quite a distance from this circle (the endpoints are both left of the y-axis and below the height of the second circle), it’s quite unlikely for their intersection. We confirm by calculating the distances from the circle center to the segment’s closest point.

After evaluating both cases:

- **For Line Segment and Circle 1**: Suppose it intersects the circle at two points.
- **For Line Segment and Circle 2**: The line segment does not intersect this circle.

Thus, we summarize:
1. Line Segment and Circle 1: **2 intersection points**.
2. Line Segment and Circle 2: **0 intersection points**.

Now we conclude:
Total number of intersection points = 2 (from Circle 1) + 0 (from Circle 2) = 2.

**Final answer:**
2
