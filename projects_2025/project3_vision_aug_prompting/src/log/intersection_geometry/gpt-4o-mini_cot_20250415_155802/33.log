========================================
problem: There is a circle centered at (0.7, -0.8) with radius 2.0. There is a circle centered at (-1.3, 0.8) with radius 3.0. How many intersection points are there?
result: To find the number of intersection points between the two circles, we need to consider the distances between their centers and their radii.

1. Calculate the distance (d) between the centers of the circles:
   - Circle 1 is centered at (0.7, -0.8) and has a radius of 2.0.
   - Circle 2 is centered at (-1.3, 0.8) and has a radius of 3.0.
   - The distance \( d \) between the centers can be calculated using the distance formula:
     \[
     d = \sqrt{(0.7 - (-1.3))^2 + (-0.8 - 0.8)^2} = \sqrt{(0.7 + 1.3)^2 + (-0.8 - 0.8)^2} = \sqrt{(2.0)^2 + (-1.6)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 2.56} = \sqrt{6.56} \approx 2.56.
     \]

2. Determine the intersections based on the distance \( d \) and the sum and difference of the radii:
   - The sum of the radii is \( r_1 + r_2 = 2.0 + 3.0 = 5.0 \).
   - The absolute difference of the radii is \( |r_1 - r_2| = |2.0 - 3.0| = 1.0 \).

3. Now, analyze the relationship:
   - If \( d > r_1 + r_2 \): no intersection (circles are too far apart).
   - If \( d = r_1 + r_2 \): circles touch externally (1 intersection point).
   - If \( |r_1 - r_2| < d < r_1 + r_2 \): circles intersect at two points (2 intersection points).
   - If \( d = |r_1 - r_2| \): circles touch internally (1 intersection point).
   - If \( d < |r_1 - r_2| \): one circle is inside the other without touching (no intersection).

Since we calculated \( d \approx 2.56 \), \( r_1 + r_2 = 5.0 \), and \( |r_1 - r_2| = 1.0 \):
- We see that \( 1.0 < 2.56 < 5.0 \). This means the circles intersect at two points.

Thus, the output is:
