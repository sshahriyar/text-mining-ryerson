problem: There is a circle centered at (1.9, -0.6) with radius 3.0. There is a circle centered at (-0.9, -0.8) with radius 3.0. How many intersection points are there?
result: To determine the number of intersection points between the two circles specified by their centers and radii, we start by finding the distance between the centers of the circles.

1. **Circle 1:**
   - Center: \( C_1 = (1.9, -0.6) \)
   - Radius: \( r_1 = 3.0 \)

2. **Circle 2:**
   - Center: \( C_2 = (-0.9, -0.8) \)
   - Radius: \( r_2 = 3.0 \)

Next, we calculate the distance \( d \) between the centers \( C_1 \) and \( C_2 \):

\[
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]
Substituting the values:

\[
d = \sqrt{((-0.9) - (1.9))^2 + ((-0.8) - (-0.6))^2}
\]

Calculating the differences:

\[
d = \sqrt{(-2.8)^2 + (-0.2)^2}
\]
\[
= \sqrt{7.84 + 0.04} = \sqrt{7.88} \approx 2.8
\]

Now we compare \( d \) with the sum and difference of the radii:

- The sum of the radii: \( r_1 + r_2 = 3.0 + 3.0 = 6.0 \)
- The absolute difference of the radii: \( |r_1 - r_2| = |3.0 - 3.0| = 0 \)

Since \( d = 2.8 < 6.0 \) and \( d = 2.8 > 0 \), the two circles intersect at two points.

In conclusion, the number of intersection points between the two circles is:
