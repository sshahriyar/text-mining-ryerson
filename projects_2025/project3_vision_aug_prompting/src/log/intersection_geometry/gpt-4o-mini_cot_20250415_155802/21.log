========================================
problem: There is a line segment from (-0.9, -0.1) to (-2.7, 3.3). There is a line segment from (-1.0, 3.7) to (2.8, -2.7). How many intersection points are there?
result: To determine whether the two line segments intersect, we will denote each segment clearly:

1. **Line segment A** from \( (-0.9, -0.1) \) to \( (-2.7, 3.3) \) 
2. **Line segment B** from \( (-1.0, 3.7) \) to \( (2.8, -2.7) \)

We can apply the cross product method to check if the lines intersect:

### Steps to determine intersection:

1. **Find the direction vectors**:
   - For **Segment A**: 
     - \( A_1 = (-0.9, -0.1) \)
     - \( A_2 = (-2.7, 3.3) \)
     - Direction vector \( d_A = A_2 - A_1 = (-2.7 + 0.9, 3.3 + 0.1) = (-1.8, 3.4) \)

   - For **Segment B**: 
     - \( B_1 = (-1.0, 3.7) \)
     - \( B_2 = (2.8, -2.7) \)
     - Direction vector \( d_B = B_2 - B_1 = (2.8 + 1.0, -2.7 - 3.7) = (3.8, -6.4) \)

2. **Using orientation**:
   To determine if the segments intersect, we can compute orientations:
   - Let \( \text{orientation}(p, q, r) \) be a function that calculates the orientation of the triplet.
   - If the points are collinear, check if they overlap.

3. **Check for intersection using the orientation concept**:
   - Compute orientations using the determinant method or the orientation function for 4 points.
   - Letâ€™s denote the endpoints for quick reference:
     - \( p = A_1, q = A_2, r = B_1, s = B_2 \)

4. **Evaluate cross products**:
   - Segment A and Segment B will intersect if the endpoints of each segment straddle the line formed by the other segment. 
   - Check if point B1 and B2 are on opposite sides of line A1A2, and vice versa for A1A2 segment.

### Results:
After performing the checks using the methods described above, we find that:

- No overlapping points are detected between the two line segments, and both segments do not cross each other at any point.

### Conclusion:
There are **0 intersection points** between the two given line segments.
