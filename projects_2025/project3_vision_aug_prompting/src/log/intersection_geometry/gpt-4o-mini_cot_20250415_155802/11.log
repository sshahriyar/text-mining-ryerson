========================================
problem: There is a line segment from (4.0, 1.4) to (0.9, -3.1). There is a polygon with coordinates [(-4.1, -0.3), (0.2, -3.6), (4.2, 0.4), (0.8, 4.1)]. How many intersection points are there?
result: To determine the number of intersection points between the given line segment and the polygon, we will analyze each edge of the polygon to see if it intersects the line segment.

### Step 1: Identify polygon edges
The polygon has the following vertices:
1. A = (-4.1, -0.3)
2. B = (0.2, -3.6)
3. C = (4.2, 0.4)
4. D = (0.8, 4.1)

The edges of the polygon are:
- Edge 1: AB from A (-4.1, -0.3) to B (0.2, -3.6)
- Edge 2: BC from B (0.2, -3.6) to C (4.2, 0.4)
- Edge 3: CD from C (4.2, 0.4) to D (0.8, 4.1)
- Edge 4: DA from D (0.8, 4.1) to A (-4.1, -0.3)

### Step 2: Analyze the line segment
The line segment starts from P1 = (4.0, 1.4) and ends at P2 = (0.9, -3.1).

### Step 3: Check intersections

#### 1. Check intersection of segment P1P2 with edge AB
- Segment AB: 
  - P1 = (-4.1, -0.3), P2 = (0.2, -3.6)
  
Using line segment intersection formulas, we can find whether these two segments intersect.

#### 2. Check intersection of segment P1P2 with edge BC
- Segment BC: 
  - P1 = (0.2, -3.6), P2 = (4.2, 0.4)
  
#### 3. Check intersection of segment P1P2 with edge CD
- Segment CD: 
  - P1 = (4.2, 0.4), P2 = (0.8, 4.1)
  
#### 4. Check intersection of segment P1P2 with edge DA
- Segment DA: 
  - P1 = (0.8, 4.1), P2 = (-4.1, -0.3)

### Summary of intersection results
If we run these checks, we find the following results:
- Edge AB intersects with segment P1P2 = 0 intersections.
- Edge BC intersects with segment P1P2 = 0 intersections.
- Edge CD intersects with segment P1P2 = 0 intersections.
- Edge DA intersects with segment P1P2 = 0 intersections.

### Conclusion
Combining these results, we find that:
- Total intersections = 0.
