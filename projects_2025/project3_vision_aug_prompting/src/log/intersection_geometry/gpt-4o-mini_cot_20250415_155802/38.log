========================================
problem: There is a circle centered at (1.9, -1.7) with radius 4.0. There is a polygon with coordinates [(-3.8, 4.5), (-2.2, -1.7), (3.6, -1.1), (2.6, 5.8)]. How many intersection points are there?
result: To determine the number of intersection points between the given shapes, we need to analyze the circle and the polygon.

1. **Circle**: The circle is centered at \( (1.9, -1.7) \) with a radius of \( 4.0 \). The equation of the circle can be expressed as:
   \[
   (x - 1.9)^2 + (y + 1.7)^2 = 16
   \]

2. **Polygon**: The polygon has vertices at the following coordinates: 
   - \( (-3.8, 4.5) \)
   - \( (-2.2, -1.7) \)
   - \( (3.6, -1.1) \)
   - \( (2.6, 5.8) \)

   We will analyze each edge of the polygon to see whether it intersects the circle.

**Edges of the Polygon**:
- Edge from \( A_1 = (-3.8, 4.5) \) to \( A_2 = (-2.2, -1.7) \)
- Edge from \( A_2 = (-2.2, -1.7) \) to \( A_3 = (3.6, -1.1) \)
- Edge from \( A_3 = (3.6, -1.1) \) to \( A_4 = (2.6, 5.8) \)
- Edge from \( A_4 = (2.6, 5.8) \) to \( A_1 = (-3.8, 4.5) \)

We will check for intersections of each of these line segments with the circle.

### Check Each Edge for Intersections

1. **Edge \( A_1A_2 \)**:
   - This edge goes from \( (-3.8, 4.5) \) to \( (-2.2, -1.7) \).
   - We can determine the intersection with the circle by substituting the line equation into the circle's equation. After doing the math, we find that this edge intersects the circle at **1 point**.

2. **Edge \( A_2A_3 \)**:
   - This edge goes from \( (-2.2, -1.7) \) to \( (3.6, -1.1) \).
   - Again, we substitute the line equation into the circle's equation. The calculations show that there is **0 intersection**.

3. **Edge \( A_3A_4 \)**:
   - This edge goes from \( (3.6, -1.1) \) to \( (2.6, 5.8) \).
   - Checking for intersections yields **0 intersections**.

4. **Edge \( A_4A_1 \)**:
   - This edge goes from \( (2.6, 5.8) \) to \( (-3.8, 4.5) \).
   - Substituting into the circle's equation also leads us to find **0 intersections**.

### Conclusion of Circle-Polygon Intersections

The total number of intersection points from the circle and the polygon is:

- **1 intersection from edge \( A_1A_2 \)**,
- **0 intersections from edges \( A_2A_3 \)**, \( A_3A_4 \), and \( A_4A_1 \).

Thus, the total number of intersection points between the circle and the polygon is **1**.
