========================================
problem: There is a circle centered at (-0.5, 1.6) with radius 2.0. There is a polygon with coordinates [(1.1, 1.5), (-4.6, 0.9), (-4.8, -6.7), (2.3, -3.6)]. How many intersection points are there?
result: To determine the number of intersection points between the circle and the polygon, we need to analyze their configurations based on their descriptions. 

1. **Circle:**
   - Center: (-0.5, 1.6)
   - Radius: 2.0
   
   The equation of the circle can be expressed as:
   \[
   (x + 0.5)^2 + (y - 1.6)^2 = 4
   \]

2. **Polygon:**
   - Vertices: (1.1, 1.5), (-4.6, 0.9), (-4.8, -6.7), (2.3, -3.6)
   - We will consider the edges of the polygon to find potential intersection points with the circle.

The polygon has four edges, created by connecting consecutive vertices:

- Edge 1: (1.1, 1.5) to (-4.6, 0.9)
- Edge 2: (-4.6, 0.9) to (-4.8, -6.7)
- Edge 3: (-4.8, -6.7) to (2.3, -3.6)
- Edge 4: (2.3, -3.6) to (1.1, 1.5)

Now, we will analyze each edge for intersection with the circle:

1. **Edge 1: (1.1, 1.5) to (-4.6, 0.9)**
   - We find the equation of the line formed by these points and test for intersection with the circle.
   - Calculation shows that this line intersects the circle at 1 point.

2. **Edge 2: (-4.6, 0.9) to (-4.8, -6.7)**
   - Similar analysis provides the intersection count, which shows 0 intersections with the circle.

3. **Edge 3: (-4.8, -6.7) to (2.3, -3.6)**
   - Analyzing this edge also results in 0 intersections.

4. **Edge 4: (2.3, -3.6) to (1.1, 1.5)**
   - Analysis reveals this edge intersects the circle at 1 point.

Now we can summarize the intersection counts:

- Edge 1: 1 intersection
- Edge 2: 0 intersections
- Edge 3: 0 intersections
- Edge 4: 1 intersection

Adding up the intersection points gives us:
\[
1 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 2 \text{ total intersections.}
\]

So the total number of intersection points between the circle and the polygon is:

**Answer: 2**
