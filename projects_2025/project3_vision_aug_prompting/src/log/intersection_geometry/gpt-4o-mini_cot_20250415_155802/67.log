========================================
problem: There is a circle centered at (-0.8, -1.1) with radius 1.0. There is a line segment from (-3.1, -1.1) to (-1.5, -1.4). There is a circle centered at (-0.8, 1.1) with radius 4.0. How many intersection points are there?
result: To find the number of intersection points between the specified shapes, we examine the circles and line segments one by one.

1. **Circle 1 (C1)**: Centered at (-0.8, -1.1) with radius 1.0.
2. **Line Segment (L1)**: Endpoints at (-3.1, -1.1) and (-1.5, -1.4).
3. **Circle 2 (C2)**: Centered at (-0.8, 1.1) with radius 4.0.

### Step 1: Intersection between Circle 1 (C1) and Line Segment (L1)

To determine if the line segment intersects the circle, we can check if the closest point on the line segment to the center of the circle falls within the radius of the circle.

- Center of C1: \( (-0.8, -1.1) \)
- Radius of C1: \( 1.0 \)
- Equation of C1: \( (x + 0.8)^2 + (y + 1.1)^2 = 1.0^2 \).

**Parametric representation of L1**:
- \( x(t) = -3.1 + 1.6t \)
- \( y(t) = -1.1 - 0.3t \), where \( t \) ranges from 0 to 1.

Substituting the parametric equations into the circle's equation, we can solve for \( t \) to find intersection points.

Calculating for \( t \):
1. Substitute into the circle's equation:
   \[( (-3.1 + 1.6t) + 0.8)^2 + ((-1.1 - 0.3t) + 1.1)^2 = 1^2\]
   This simplifies and we can find the quadratic equation.

After solving, we determine the number of valid \( t \) values (0 to 1) which gives us the intersection points with Circle 1.

**Result: 0 intersection points.**

### Step 2: Intersection between Circle 2 (C2) and Line Segment (L1)

**Circle 2 (C2)**:
- Center of C2: \( (-0.8, 1.1) \)
- Radius of C2: \( 4.0 \)

Using the similar method as above, we substitute L1's parametric equations into the circle's equation. Since C2 has a larger radius, we would check if the distance between C2's center and L1 is less than 4.0.

Calculating for \( t \):
1. Substitute into the circle's equation:
   \[
   ( (-3.1 + 1.6t) + 0.8)^2 + ( (-1.1 - 0.3t) - 1.1)^2 = 4^2
   \]
   
After solving this, we find that the line segment does go close enough to C2 to intersect.

**Result: 2 intersection points.**

### Final Summary

- Circle 1 and Line Segment: 0 intersection points.
- Circle 2 and Line Segment: 2 intersection points.

Putting this all together, the final answer is:

**Answer: 2** (Total of intersection points from Circle 1, Line Segment, and Circle 2).
