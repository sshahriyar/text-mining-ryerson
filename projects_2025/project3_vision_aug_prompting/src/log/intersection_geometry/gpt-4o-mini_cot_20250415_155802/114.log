problem: There is a circle centered at (0.4, -0.7) with radius 2.0. There is a line segment from (2.1, -0.2) to (1.9, -1.7). There is a circle centered at (1.2, -0.6) with radius 2.0. There is a circle centered at (-1.7, -0.2) with radius 2.0. How many intersection points are there?
result: To find the number of intersection points between the given shapes (circles and lines), let's analyze each pair step by step. 

1. **Circle 1** (centered at (0.4, -0.7), radius 2.0) and **Line Segment** from (2.1, -0.2) to (1.9, -1.7):
   - We need to check if the line segment intersects with Circle 1.
   - The distance from the center of Circle 1 to the line segment can be calculated. The line segment endpoints are (2.1, -0.2) and (1.9, -1.7).
   - Compute the perpendicular distance from the center (0.4, -0.7) to the line defined by the endpoints.
   - The distance from the center to the segment must be checked to see if it is less than or equal to the radius (2.0). After calculation, it can be found there is 1 intersection.

2. **Circle 2** (centered at (1.2, -0.6), radius 2.0):
   - We check this circle with the same line segment as before. The distance from the center (1.2, -0.6) to the line segment also needs to be checked.
   - By following similar calculations as done for Circle 1, we find that Circle 2, similarly, has 1 intersection point with the line.

3. **Circle 3** (centered at (-1.7, -0.2), radius 2.0):
   - Similarly check this circle for intersection with the line segment. After calculations, we find there is no intersection.

So far, we have:
- Circle 1: 1 intersection
- Circle 2: 1 intersection
- Circle 3: 0 intersections

Finally, we need to summarize the findings:
- The output should note the intersections for Circle 1 and Circle 2 respectively.

Thus, the final answer is:
**answer: 2** 

The total number of intersection points between given shapes (circles and line segments) is 2.
