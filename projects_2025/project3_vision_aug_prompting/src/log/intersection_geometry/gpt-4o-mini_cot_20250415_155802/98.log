========================================
problem: There is a circle centered at (-1.0, 1.9) with radius 2.0. There is a circle centered at (0.9, -1.8) with radius 3.0. There is a polygon with coordinates [(-1.4, 1.9), (0.1, -5.5), (6.9, -0.1)]. There is a circle centered at (-0.7, -0.9) with radius 3.0. How many intersection points are there?
result: To find the number of intersection points between the shapes specified in the input, we will analyze each pair of shapes one by one.

1. **Circle (1) and Circle (2)**:
   - Circle (1): Center at (-1.0, 1.9) with radius 2.0.
   - Circle (2): Center at (0.9, -1.8) with radius 3.0.
   - The distance between the centers can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     d = \sqrt{(0.9 - (-1.0))^2 + (-1.8 - 1.9)^2} = \sqrt{(1.9)^2 + (-3.7)^2} = \sqrt{3.61 + 13.69} = \sqrt{17.3} \approx 4.15
     \]
   - The sum of the radii is \(2.0 + 3.0 = 5.0\) and the absolute difference of the radii is \(3.0 - 2.0 = 1.0\).
   - Since \(1.0 < d < 5.0\), the circles intersect at two points.

2. **Circle (1) and Polygon**:
   - Polygon vertices: [(-1.4, 1.9), (0.1, -5.5), (6.9, -0.1)].
   - We will check each line segment of the polygon to see if it intersects Circle (1). 
   - Segments: 
     1. From (-1.4, 1.9) to (0.1, -5.5)
     2. From (0.1, -5.5) to (6.9, -0.1)
     3. From (6.9, -0.1) to (-1.4, 1.9)
   - Upon checking these segments, only the first segment intersects with Circle (1) at one point. 

3. **Circle (2) and Polygon**:
   - Now we check for intersections between Circle (2) and the same segments of the polygon.
   - After checking, only the second segment intersects with Circle (2) at one point.
  
4. **Circle (3) and Polygon**:
   - Circle at (-0.7, -0.9) with a radius of 3.0.
   - We will also check the polygonâ€™s segments against this new circle. 
   - The checks reveal that there are no intersections.

Now we summarize the intersections we found:

- Circle (1) and Circle (2): 2 intersections
- Circle (1) and Polygon: 1 intersection (from one segment)
- Circle (2) and Polygon: 1 intersection (from another segment)
- Circle (3) and Polygon: 0 intersections
  
Overall, we find the total number of intersection points as: 

- **Total intersections between circles and shapes = 2 (from Circles) + 1 + 1 = 4.**

Therefore, the final answer is:

**output: 4**
pred_answer: 0
ground truth: 14
