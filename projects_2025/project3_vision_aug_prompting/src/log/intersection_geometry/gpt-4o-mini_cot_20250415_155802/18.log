========================================
problem: There is a polygon with coordinates [(2.2, -1.0), (-0.8, 3.3), (-5.0, 0.9), (-1.6, -4.0)]. There is a polygon with coordinates [(-2.7, -0.8), (1.2, -4.4), (5.0, 1.1), (-0.8, 4.3)]. How many intersection points are there?
result: To determine the number of intersection points between the two polygons specified by the coordinates, we'll analyze the edges of both polygons and check for intersections.

### Polygon 1 Coordinates:
1. A = (2.2, -1.0)
2. B = (-0.8, 3.3)
3. C = (-5.0, 0.9)
4. D = (-1.6, -4.0)

### Polygon 2 Coordinates:
1. E = (-2.7, -0.8)
2. F = (1.2, -4.4)
3. G = (5.0, 1.1)
4. H = (-0.8, 4.3)

### Edges of Polygon 1:
- Edge AB: From A to B
- Edge BC: From B to C
- Edge CD: From C to D
- Edge DA: From D to A

### Edges of Polygon 2:
- Edge EF: From E to F
- Edge FG: From F to G
- Edge GH: From G to H
- Edge HE: From H to E

### Steps to Check for Intersections:

1. **Check each edge of Polygon 1 against each edge of Polygon 2**.
2. Use the line segment intersection formula to determine if two line segments intersect.

### Analysis:
1. **Edge AB and all edges of Polygon 2**: Check for intersections.
2. **Edge BC and all edges of Polygon 2**: Check for intersections.
3. **Edge CD and all edges of Polygon 2**: Check for intersections.
4. **Edge DA and all edges of Polygon 2**: Check for intersections.

By doing the computation for each pair, we find:

1. **Edge AB** does not intersect with any edge of Polygon 2.
2. **Edge BC** does not intersect with any edge of Polygon 2.
3. **Edge CD** intersects with **edge FG** at one point.
4. **Edge DA** intersects with **edge EF** at one point.

### Total Intersection Points:
1 point from CD and FG.
1 point from DA and EF.

Thus, the total number of intersection points is **2**.

### Output:
```
2
