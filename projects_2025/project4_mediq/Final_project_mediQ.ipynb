        "\n",
        "#### Problem Description:\n",
        "\n",
        "MEDIQ set out to study how to improve LLMs through the ability to ask follow-up questions. Typically, LLMs will answer questions based on the information they are provided in one go (called single-turn Q&A), and to better align to real-world conversations, this projects explores if the LLMs (GPT-4 and LLaMA-3) could be trained to ask follow-up questions when they do not have enough information.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Context of the Problem:\n",
        "![](https://github.com/aadarshachapagain/Meqiq_bench/blob/main/media/problem_context.png?raw=true)\n",
        "\n",
        "Vanilla LLMs are trained to answer any question, even with incomplete context or insufficient knowledge. This approach raises concerns about the reliability of the system, especially in domains like medicine and healthcare, where reliability is critically important. Gathering more contextual information before answering questions can significantly improve the system's reliability.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Limitation About other Approaches:\n",
        "\n",
        "![](https://github.com/aadarshachapagain/Meqiq_bench/blob/main/media/limitation_of_other_approaches.png?raw=true)\n",
        "\n",
        "The primary limitation across prior approaches is their insufficient support for proactive information-seeking behavior. While some enhance domain-specific accuracy (e.g., via PubMed finetuning) or improve interactive performance using conversational data, most systems still fail to dynamically elicit missing or critical patient information. Additionally, several methods focus on synthetic or simplified datasets, limiting their applicability to real-world, nuanced medical scenarios. Few address abstention, uncertainty modeling, or dynamic questioning, which are crucial for safe and effective medical decision-making.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Solution:\n",
        "\n",
        "![](https://github.com/aadarshachapagain/Meqiq_bench/blob/main/media/solution.png?raw=true)\n",
        "\n",
        "Asking questions when information is insufficient for diagnosis helps gather vital details for decision-making. The use of two modules—an expert system and a patient system—enables the collection of sufficient information before making decisions. Decisions made with adequate information are inherently more reliable.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Patient system\n",
        "The Patient system simulates a patient in clinical conversations and has access to the entire medical record, including symptoms, history, and relevant details.\n",
        "\n",
        "Its primary role is to respond factually and relevantly to the Expert’s follow-up questions.\n",
        "\n",
        "The system is evaluated on:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Factuality: Are the responses consistent with the record?\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Relevance: Do the responses directly answer the Expert’s questions?\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiple variants were explored (e.g., Direct, Instruct, Fact-Select), with Fact-Select achieving the best performance due to structured, atomic fact usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Expert System\n",
        "The Expert system simulates a clinical decision-maker who begins with partial information and iteratively asks follow-up questions to make accurate diagnoses.\n",
        "\n",
        "It decides whether to answer or ask based on its confidence, using various abstention strategies (e.g., binary, scale-based, rationale generation).\n",
        "\n",
        "Its effectiveness is judged by:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Accuracy of the final diagnosis.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Efficiency, measured by the number of questions asked.\n",

        "\n",
        "The abstention mechanism in the MEDIQ framework is a critical component of the Expert System, designed to decide when the model should withhold a final answer and instead ask a follow-up question to gather more information. This approach helps avoid premature or incorrect diagnoses in situations of uncertainty—particularly vital in high-stakes clinical settings.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What is Abstention  <br>\n",
        "Abstention allows the Expert system to pause decision-making when it lacks confidence and proactively seek additional information from the Patient system. This helps reduce hallucinated or overconfident answers.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How Abstention Works (5-Step Expert Pipeline Context)\n",
        "It is part of the second step in the 5-step Expert pipeline:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Initial Assessment: Understand symptoms/options and identify missing info.\n",
        "2. Abstention Module:  Estimate confidence; decide to answer or ask.\n",
        "3. Question Generation: Generate a targeted follow-up question if abstaining.\n",
        "4. Information Integration:  Update internal knowledge with new responses.\n",
        "5. Decision Making:  Make a final diagnosis when confident.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Variants of Abstention Strategies\n",
        "1. BASIC (Implicit)<br>\n",
        "  a. Model decides implicitly: If it’s confident, it answers; if not, it asks a question.<br>\n",
        "  b. No explicit confidence signal is produced.\n",
        "2. Numerical<br>\n",
        "  a. Model generates a confidence score (0.0 to 1.0).<br>\n",
        "  b. A fixed threshold (e.g., 0.7) determines whether to proceed or abstain.\n",
        "  Limitation: LLMs struggle with calibrated numerical confidence.\n",
        "3. Binary<br>\n",
        "  a.Model is asked directly: \"Are you confident?\"<br>\n",
        "  b. It answers YES (proceed) or NO (ask a question).<br>\n",
        "  c. Simpler and more robust than numerical.\n",
        "4. Scale<br>\n",
        "  Confidence is expressed via a 5-point Likert scale:<br>\n",
